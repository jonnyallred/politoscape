<p>Physician, heal thyself. </p>
<p>When host David Gregory brings up Jack Welch's completely unsubstantiated assertion that ""Chicago politicians"" had finagled the job numbers somehow to drop the unemployment rate to below 8% just a month before the election, he immediately goes to Republican Newt Gingrich for validation.  And of course, the Newtster is happy to oblige, acknowledging that it is ""plausible"" that the numbers have been fudged, evidence be damned.

We have corroded?what we?re doing, we are corroding trust in our government in our way.  And one-time responsible people are doing to control it.  And the idea that Donald Trump, Jack Welch, rich people with crazy conspiracies, can get traction on this is a bad trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chuckie bubbeleh, you want to know why people like Donald Trump and Jack Welch get traction?  Look in the damn mirror.  </p>
<p>Being a <a href=""http://www.policymic.com/articles/3355/why-government-can-t-be-run-like-a-business"">successful CEO does not give you special insight into the greater economy, or how to govern around it</a>.  They're different beasts entirely.  But you and your mainstream media colleagues continue to disinform your viewership by playing these ""both sides do it"" false equivalencies and never, ever coming down on lies told by your interviewees.  There's no consequence to Jack Welch throwing that wildly bizarre statement out; you'll interview him again when the next jobs report comes out.  </p>
<p>By all rights, people like <a href=""http://www.newshounds.us/trump_wants_romney_to_go_birther_in_the_debate_10032012"">Donald Trump</a>, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/jack-welch-white-house_n_1946903.html"">Jack Welch</a>, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/07/30/newt_gingrich_on_the_great_muslim_brotherhood_conspiracy_i_think_it_s_fair_to_ask_.html"">Newt Gingrich</a>, <a href=""http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/coulter-claims-only-liberal-media-ar"">Ann Coulter</a> and <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/how-sarah-palins-latest-media-conspiracy-theory-harms-the-right/251106/"">Sarah Palin</a> have forfeited their rights of being taken credibly as a talking head for being so monstrously and crazily wrong. Repeatedly. But they never lose their seats at the table. And people who have spoken forcefully and with facts on their side rarely, if ever, get a chance to voice them.  </p>
<p>That's on you.  There's a reason why we no longer trust our pillar institutions--including the news media--because <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/01/1115636/-Diary-of-a-Beltway-Factotum-Wonks-and-Wieners"">you've decided to be buddies inside the Beltway</a>.  Your cocktail parties and barbeques are more important than holding people in power accountable.  So if these ""once responsible"" people are making you crazy, all I can tell you is ""Heal thyself"" and stop giving them credibility.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Mary Matalin on Sunday attempted to lecture Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, saying he had ""lied"" by claiming Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan's wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher system.</p>
<p>During panel discussion on ABC's <em>This Week</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> columnist Peggy Noonan asserted that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had held himself during last week's debate by appearing to be ""a completely moderate, centrist figure.""</p>
<p>""Except that everything he used to claim his centrism wasn't true,"" Krugman pointed out. ""So, this is a question. Does that start to take its toll over the next few months... When you say my plan covers pre-existing conditions when it doesn't and when your own campaign has admitted in the past that it doesn't, what do you say? That's amazing.""</p>
<p>""You have mischaracterized and you have lied about every position and every particular of the Ryan plan on Medicare,"" Matalin interrupted, ""from the efficiency of the Medicare administration to calling it a voucher plan.""</p>
<p>""It is a voucher plan,"" Krugman replied.</p>
<p>""You are hardly credible on calling somebody else a liar,"" Matalin quipped. </p>
<p>Krugman quickly returned to Romney's claim during the debate, that his health care plan covered pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>""I just think that pre-existing thing was a defining moment,"" he observed. ""It was saying this guy believes -- not only did he say something that isn't true, but something that his own campaign has admitted isn't true. And he can say it in front of 70 million people. That's amazing.""</p>
<p>As Think Progress <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/10/07/972441/mary-matalin-calls-paul-krugman-a-liar-for-telling-the-truth/"">noted</a>, Ryan himself has <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/paul-ryan-didnt-always-shy-away-from-the-word-vo"">described his plan</a> as ""converting Medicare into defined contribution sort of voucher system.""</p>

There are a lot of words you could use for this panel segment, most of which I can't use here because we like to keep the site safe for work, but ""great"" isn't one of them.</p>

She ran up against both Krugman and ABC's Johnathan Karl calling her out for her nonsense, but when Karl brought up the fact that he set a record for the number of vetoes, she just shrugged it off.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid any reality is allowed to be acknowledged if it gets in the way of their talking points.</p>

<p>Transcript below the fold of Noonan doing her best to get the Etch-a-Sketch out for Mitt Romney and his debate performance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOONAN:  I think one of the key things about the debate is it's changed -- we will look back on it as an historic moment in this election.  It upended things.  This is what it upended.  Barack Obama was supposed to be the sort of moderate centrist fellow, who looked at Mitt Romney, this extreme, strange fellow.  By the time that debate was over, Mitt Romney seemed a completely moderate, centrist figure, who showed up as Mitt Romney the governor, not as Mitt Romney the candidate.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>KRUGMAN:  Except that everything he used to claim his centrism wasn't true, so this is a question, does that start to take its toll over the next few months. </strong></p>
<p>(CROSSTALK) </p>
<p>NOONAN:  I just think that is unjust.  I mean, to say the very least -- </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK) </p>
<p>KRUGMAN:  When you say my covers pre-existing conditions when it doesn't and when your own campaign has admitted in the past that it doesn't, what do you say?  That's amazing. </p>
<p>MATALIN:  You have Mitt characterized -- and you have lied about every position and every particular of the Ryan plan on Medicare from the efficiency of Medicare administration to calling it a voucher plan, so you're hardly... </p>
<p>KRUGMAN:  It is a voucher plan. </p>
<p>MATALIN:  You are hardly credible on calling somebody else a liar.  Here's what else... </p>
<p><strong>KRUGMAN:  Well, if you're going to make this not about that -- but, no, the fact of the matter, I just think that pre-existing condition thing was a defining moment.  It was saying this guy believes not only he can say something that isn't true, but something that his own complain has admitted isn't true.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And he can say it in front of 70 million people.  That's amazing. </strong></p>
<p>MATALIN:  The other thing this upended was Governor Romney effectively shut down the legions of strawmen that the Obama campaign has erected against him and Mitt Romney, the real Mitt Romney is, what was belied all the stereotypes and demonic mischaracterizations of him, these $300 million of attack ads. </p>
<p>So people got to see, as Ed said, the real Mitt Romney and they liked his positions.  They support all those positions.  And they like him as a person, which is what he needed to do at the convention and the debate. </p>
<p><strong>NOONAN:  And also Mitt Romney also nailed the president on not working well with the other party and made the point that he can work well with the other party as he did in Massachusetts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>KARL:  Yeah, he set the record for vetoes in Massachusetts. </strong></p>
<p>(CROSSTALK) </p>
<p><strong>NOONAN: If you have an 87 percent Democratic legislature you've got to veto a few things.</strong></p></blockquote>

 H/t David for video.</p>
<p>God, Mary Matalin is such an old, bitter, sourpuss, isn't she? Look at how angry she gets when Paul Krugman contradicts her on the facts. Guess it must really suck being the one with no credibility!</p>
<blockquote><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you brought up the trend over the last year, and I want to come to you in a second, Jon. But first, let's put up this chart we have showing that trend across several presidencies of the last year of an incumbent running for president, and it does show, Mary Matalin, that President Obama's improvement in the unemployment rate in an election year is in the green zone, in the zone where presidents get re-elected.</p>
<p>MATALIN: Here is the real world, as Peggy alluded to. <strong>Real median incomes have fallen twice as much under the Obama recovery as they did in the Bush recession. At this point in time, under Ronald Reagan's policies, which Governor Reagan has a 21st century application of, growth and jobs were growing at five times the rate they are.</strong></p>
<p>Let's just look at last year. The states where 17 governors, Republican governors instituted conservative reforms, those states are growing their economy and creating jobs at twice the rate the national one. This is about policies. We know they've worked. There is no recovery in the history of any recessions or depressions that have been as slow and as poor as this one and the revisions upwards --</p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p>MATALIN: <strong>Yes, it is, Dr. Krugman. It's completely, totally true.</strong></p>
<p>KRUGMAN:<strong> I'm sorry, but it just isn't true.</strong></p>
<p>MATALIN: <strong>I don't make up numbers.</strong></p>
<p>KRUGMAN: <strong>Well, but just look at them, then. Because the fact of the matter is, this is actually a fairly typical slow post-financial crisis recovery, which is picking up speed. So although it's terrible -- and I've been bitterly critical of policymakers in general for not doing more -- the fact of the matter is we are clearly now in the upswing, where you can see the beginnings of a turnaround.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>""Gov. Romney had a masterful, theatrical performance just this last week, but the underpinnings and foundation of that performance were fundamentally dishonest,"" Gibbs told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""You cannot cut taxes by $5 trillion as he's doing and simply say, 'Oh, I don't have that tax cut, I'm not going to cut taxes for the wealthy,' when the average high-income earner is going to get a $250,000 tax cut.""</p>
<p>Stephanopolous pointed out that the Romney campaign has asserted that President Barack Obama's campaign had been lying about the $5 trillion tax cut.</p>
<p>""Absolutely not,"" Gibbs insisted. ""If you're going to reduce the Bush tax rates by 20 percent and the estate tax and the [alternative minimum tax], change the corporate rate and whole host of other changes, that adds up in a reduction of revenue of $4.8 trillion. The question for Gov. Romney is, what loopholes are you going to close -- supposedly -- to make up for that revenue?""</p>
<p>""Let's be clear, [Republican vice presidential nominee] Paul Ryan a week ago was asked about the math for this, and Paul Ryan said, 'Look, the math takes to long,'"" he continued. ""Well, Mitt Romney's solution is he just decided there isn't math involved in this problem. And that's absolutely crazy.""</p>
<p>""The only thing that he outlined that he would cut in the budget is Big Bird. You know, he's taken the battle straight to Sesame Street and let Wall Street run hog wild. Again, it was a masterful, theatrical performance. It was fundamentally dishonest for the American people.""</p>

<p>""I don?t have a $5 trillion tax cut,"" Romney had said on Wednesday. ""I don?t have a tax cut of a scale that you?re talking about.""</p>
<p>""Both sides since the debate have been saying that the other candidate is lying about his position,"" Wallace told Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) on Sunday. ""The president keeps saying that Mitt Romney is proposing a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not true.""</p>
<p>""Wait a minute here,"" O'Malley replied. ""Former Gov. Romney is proposing a 20 percent cut to income taxes, including income taxes for the wealthiest Americans. And I believe a 30 percent cut for corporate income taxes, including for people like big oil that are socking all of us at the pump right now. Any economist can debate whether that adds up to $4.9 trillion or does it add up to $5 trillion? But the fact of the matter is in this debate, we saw Big Bird meet the big lie.""</p>
<p>Wallace argued that O'Malley was ""mischaracterizing"" Romney's plan because the former Massachusetts governor had promised to make the tax cuts revenue neutral by closing loopholes, although he has refused to say which loopholes.</p>
<p>""Gov. Romney has not said what he secret plan is for paying for these $5 trillion tax cuts,"" O'Malley explained. ""Just like he won't talk about what his tax returns have been or how much money he's sheltering offshore.""</p>
<p>An <a href=""http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/upload/Romney-Tax-Plan_March-1-2.pdf"">analysis</a> by the the non-partisan Tax Policy Center concluded that Romney's plan would reduce revenue by $480 billion in 2015 and $5 trillion over 10 years.</p>

<p>For all the Monday-morning quarterbacking on the debates, the one thing that didn't get discussed in the mainstream media is what didn't get discussed.  Like issues that matter to Americans.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the economy matters to Americans.  But Solyndra and Dodd Frank affect Americans far less than <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/legalize-marijuana-56-percent-rasmussen-poll_n_1537706.html"">decriminalizing marijuana</a> and<a href=""http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=35793&amp;news_iv_ctrl=0&amp;abbr=daily4_""> women's reproductive health issues</a>, both of which directly affect how people involved can contribute to the economy.  And both of those topics were completely ignored, among many others, like <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/aurora-survivor-frustrated-gun-talk-debate-article-1.1175056"">gun control</a>, our <a href=""http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2012/10/some-questions-a-sentencing-fan-might-ask-during-the-upcoming-presidential-debates.html"">criminal justice system</a> and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/teach-plus/education-presidential-debates-_b_1940024.html"">education</a>. </p>
<p>But not on Up with Chris Hayes, where Rep. Peter Welch bemoans a DC culture that prevents serious adult discussions about issues that directly affect Americans in lieu of talking points.  And that is a bipartisan issue.  It's exactly the reason that these debates are useless as an exercise or political tool, as this <a href=""http://www.app.com/article/20121007/NJOPINION02/310070030/End-parties-control-presidential-debates?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Opinion|s&amp;nclick_check=1"">LTE points out aptly</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In 1987, the Republican and Democratic parties took over the presidential debates from the League of Women Voters, excluding all  other candidates and many topics of discussion. The two parties? debate  commission is corporate-sponsored, and the moderators? questions  corporate-friendly, despite the face of 40-year presidential debate  moderator,  Jim Lehrer. We need to hear from all candidates and not just  those who have promised big pharma, big oil and big defense lots of  cash and big prizes for their support, something that both Democratic  and Republican hopefuls do.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the popular, super-majority positions that will not be talked about in our debates:</p>
<p>?  Shifting billions of dollars from war preparation to education, infrastructure, green energy.</p>
<p>?  Raising taxes on the super wealthy and corporations.</p>
<p>?  Prosecuting U.S. war crimes.</p>
<p>?  Ending warrantless spying, drone wars and assassinations.</p>
<p>?  Breaking up media monopolies and undoing corporate trade agreements.</p>
<p>?  Expanding Medicare to everyone.</p>
<p>?  The drug war and criminal justice.I  am sure there are more never-debated positions that are breaking this  country apart. Tell the major parties and the debate commission to get  real and make the debate process one of inclusion.</p></blockquote>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of all the leaders who have called Lexington, Virginia their home, none is more distinguished than George Marshall?the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then plan Europe?s rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">General Marshall once said, ?The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.?  Those words were true in his time?and they still echo in ours.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">*** </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts.  They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East?a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century.  And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of the same forces that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration?s attempts to convince us of that for so long.  No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.  </p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">***</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope.  But hope is not a strategy.  We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.  ?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">? It is time to change course in the Middle East.  ?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf the region?and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination.  For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions?not just words?that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. ?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">? I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world.  The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years.  I will reverse that failure.  I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Libya, I will support the Libyan people?s efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.   </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Egypt, I will use our influence?including clear conditions on our aid?to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad?s tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them.  We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran?rather than sitting on the sidelines.  It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.  President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war ? and to potential attacks here at home ? is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11.  I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.  On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">***</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I believe that if America does not lead, others will?others who do not share our interests and our values?and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us.  America?s security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years.  I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America?s great influence?wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively?to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better?not perfect, but better. </p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">*** </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall:  ?He ? always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.?  That is the role our friends want America to play again.  And it is the role we must play. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.</p>"

<p>On Friday, October 5, according to the White House, Biden spent the day working. In the morning, he was scheduled to attend the presidential daily briefing in the Oval Office, with President Obama. That afternoon Biden was to ""meet with senior advisors,"" according to the White House.</p>
<p>For this weekend, the White House provided the following guidance: ""The Vice President will be in Wilmington, Delaware. There are no public events scheduled.""</p>
<p>As for the next three days, Biden will remain in Delaware. ""On Monday through Wednesday, the Vice President will be in Wilmington, Delaware. There are no public events scheduled.""</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Rasmussen?s write-up says, ?The generation gap remains wide.  Obama leads by double digits among those under 40.  Romney leads by double digits among those over 40.?  With a spirited performance during his debate next week against Vice President Biden, however, Paul Ryan may be able to make a dent in Obama?s advantage among younger voters ? many of whom are poised to respond to <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/winning-answer_653814.html?nopager=1"">a powerfully delivered anti-Obamacare, anti-debt, pro-growth message</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">About two-thirds of Rasmussen?s latest polling was taken after the presidential debate.  The poll that Rasmussen will release tomorrow morning will be the first taken entirely after the debate and will show whether Romney?s debate bounce was even greater than the 4 points that it looks to be right now.  Rasmussen is the first polling outfit to have released a poll taken mostly after the debate.</p>

But it isn?t. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Although Landry <em>is </em>allied with the Tea Party, Boustany is far from an ?establishment? Republican when it comes to national security issues?and especially to the question of Israel. Boustany?s <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/only-one-can-survive_651383.html"">record on Israel </a>is far outside the mainstream. He's one of only two Republicans to have ever been endorsed by J Street, the left-wing advocacy group that bills itself as ?pro-Israel, pro-peace? (with far more emphasis on the latter than the former). In 2009, he attended J Street?s first annual conference, even after Israeli ambassador Michael Oren boycotted it, citing policies from the organization ?that may impair the interests of Israel.? Boustany eventually severed all connections with the group, after discovering, he says, that ?they were dishonest with me about where their funding came from??namely, the big dollars from billionaire George Soros. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">J Street maintains that Boustany was ?with them from the beginning,? and that the party ?forced? the resignation of this ?very brave? congressman.? ?When he accepted that endorsement he aligned himself with their beliefs,? one pro-Israel activist notes. ?Severing ties with J Street because of where their funding comes from isn?t the same as severing ties because of what they believe.? Noah Pollak, the executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, points out that ""there?s no political benefit to him"" for having aligned himself with J Street, ?so we should take him at his word that this is important to him.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Boustany?s stance on Israel is unlikely to be popular with the voters in the very conservative Third Congressional District, whose Republicans overwhelmingly supported Rick Santorum over Mitt Romney in March, and who now, with a general election pitting two Republican members against each other because of redistricting, have a chance to elect someone whose foreign policy beliefs are more in line with their own. In August, Landry told me, ?I stand by Israel 100 percent.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And they might do just that. As of today, all of the mainstream Republican County (Parish) Committees who have endorsed a candidate for Congress in the member versus member race have abandoned Boustany, even though most have been his constituents for years, and endorsed Jeff Landry. Although Boustany?s got a large fundraising edge, he?s only had to run safe races before, and Landry has been having a very good couple of weeks. He?s been endorsed by the Family Research Council, the Tea Party of Louisiana; Freedom Works, Citizens United, and the Tea Party Nation. Mitt Romney recently named Landry to his ?National Catholic Coalition Committee.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Romney must believe Landry has a chance to win. And it looks like he does. </p>"

The WSJ?s account has clearly angered one of Ahmad?s friends ? Mohammed al Zawahiri, who <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/zawahiris-brother-cairo-embassy-assault_652217.html"">helped lead the protest</a> at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo the same day as the attack in Libya. Mohammed al Zawahiri is the younger brother of al Qaeda emir Ayman al Zawahiri.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/54876/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-Islamist-played-no-role-in-Benghazi-attac.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Ahram Online</em></a> reports today that Mohammed al Zawahiri is ?slamming? the WSJ account. Mohammed al Zawahiri claims that ?the Salafist movement does not commit acts of violence and that Ahmad is innocent.? He adds that the WSJ article is just an attempt to stir up trouble between Salafist groups and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">No one should take Mohammed al Zawahiri at his word. As a commander in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) organization, a core part of the al Qaeda joint venture, he has established a web of nefarious ties that go far beyond his brother. In fact, according to the very same WSJ article Mohammed al Zawahiri objects to, he helped put Ahmad in touch with Ayman al Zawahiri.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">?U.S. officials believe [Mohammed al Zawahiri] has helped Mr. Ahmad connect with the al Qaeda chief,? the WSJ reported.  </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The WSJ explains: ?Western officials say Mr. Ahmad has petitioned the chief of al Qaeda, to whom he has long ties, for permission to launch an al Qaeda affiliate and has secured financing from al Qaeda's Yemeni wing.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Given that Ahmad?s forces are suspected of taking part in the Benghazi attack, which reportedly involved other al Qaeda parties (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar al Sharia, etc.), it would be a mistake to assume that nothing came of Ahmad?s petition of Ayman al Zawahiri. Not just anyone receives financing from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), as Ahmad reportedly has.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This brings us back to Mohammed al Zawahiri. He denies everything, of course. Mohammed al Zawahiri denies that he has resumed his terrorist career. He also denies having anything to do with the ransacking of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, claiming that he only meant to launch a protest outside the compound?s walls.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">U.S. intelligence officials, judging by the WSJ account and other reporting, clearly don?t believe Mohammed al Zawahiri?s denials. So the question becomes, what (if anything) is Morsi?s government going to do about him and his ilk? </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of course, it was Morsi?s Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government that paved the way for Egyptian Islamic Jihad members and other terrorists to be released from Egypt?s prisons in the first place.  Then there is this, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/10/world/meast/zawahiri-peace-plan/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">from CNN</a>, on September 11 of this year<a name=""_GoBack""></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class=""MsoNormal"">A source with direct knowledge of Egyptian government talks with jihadists in the Sinai says al-Zawahiri is helping negotiations. The source says al-Zawahiri has the respect of the Islamists and the trust of the new government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So while U.S. intelligence officials believe that Mohammed al Zawahiri is helping to put terrorists in touch with the head of al Qaeda, the Egyptian government ?trust(s)? him to help negotiate with terrorists in the Sinai.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It is safe to say there is a major disconnect here. </p>

But the American Enterprise Institute?s Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst, says that although we don?t really know how many undecided voters there are, ?the best bet? is that about 5 percent of voters are undecided?7 percent in the key swing state of Florida. My own guess is that these Hamlets, if indeed they ever resolve their doubts and do vote, are unlikely to be among the early voters, and so just might be influenced by incoming data in the next 30 days.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here are the facts. Total non-farm payrolls rose by 114,000 in September, with 104,000 of the new jobs added in the private sector. Previous estimates for July and August were increased by 86,000, primarily due to an upward revision in the number of government jobs added. Average hourly earnings and weekly hours worked, and the labor force participation rate all ticked up. The headline unemployment rate, computed from a separate survey of households rather than businesses, fell from 8.1 percent in August to 7.8 percent in September, prompting some conspiracy theorists, among them former GE boss Jack Welch, to claim the Labor Department cooked the books to bring the unemployment rate below that prevailing when President Obama took office, just in time for the election. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis says she is ?insulted,? as well she should be.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Now, for the spin. The Obama camp, reeling from their man?s truly dreadful performance in the first debate with Mitt Romney, says the glass is half full and filling up, slowly, but filling nevertheless. The economy Barack Obama inherited was losing 700,000 jobs a month but, thanks to the president?s financial reforms, bail out of the auto industry, stimulus package, and tough treatment of China and other unfair traders, it has added about 5.2 million jobs since the recession ended. Most important, the unemployment rate is now below 8 percent, as the president promised it would be, and that is lower than when the president inherited the economic mess created by his predecessor?s disastrous tax and deregulatory policies. So say the Obama spinners. The president himself jubilantly proclaimed, ?We have come too far to turn back now.? </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Mitt Romney sees the glass as more than half empty, and leaky. The five million jobs added since the end of the recession are only half of those lost since Obama was elected, despite the hugely expensive stimulus that contributed to the addition of over $5 trillion to the national debt, a 50 percent increase in four years. There are still 12.1 million unemployed workers, and 23 million either unemployed, involuntarily on short hours, or too discouraged to look for work, a consequence of the slowest recovery since WWII. Include these workers in the total and the U-6 unemployment rate (to use the technical jargon) remains stuck at 14.7 percent.       </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps worst of all, some 4.8 million workers have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer?the government?s definition of long-term unemployed?their skills atrophying, their savings (if any) dwindling, and their psyches badly bruised, a job being more than a pay check. This dire situation, claims Romney, is the result of the rising health care costs to be loaded onto employers by Obamacare, the drag on business investment created by the president?s anti-business rhetoric and regulatory spree, and soaring deficits.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Manhattan Institute?s Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the George W. Bush Labor Department, and is no fan of the president, nevertheless characterizes the new report as ?a very, very good employment report,? with hundreds of thousands moving into the labor force, and finding jobs. But she worries about the high U-6 unemployment rate<a name=""_GoBack""></a>. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even if this ?very, very good employment report? is helpful to Obama, it is not good enough to end the weakness in the labor market. That lasting improvement will only come when economic growth picks up, and a lot. Ed Lazear, the Stanford University professor who served as chairman of George W. Bush?s Council of Economic Advisers, sees the report as ?nothing to write home about,? while Austan Goolsbee, the University of Chicago economist who held the same post early in the Obama administration tells us we can ?take some heart? from the new jobs report. But they agree on one thing: The rate of economic growth has to pick up if the jobs market is to recover fully.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The prospects for such an acceleration in growth are not unambiguously bright. Indeed, the economy may well be slowing rather than picking up speed. The growth rate has been declining steadily, from 3.0 percent in the first quarter, to 2.0 percent in the second quarter to 1.3 percent in the third quarter, and some economists expect zero growth or recession in 2013. The year-over-year gain in retail sales in September for the 19 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters was a tiny 0.8 percent, far below the growth in July (4.8 percent), August (6.1 percent), and last September (5.5 percent). Real spending is growing only modestly and incomes are growing more slowly than expected, according to Goldman Sachs. The hot apartment rental market seems to be cooling, with the decline in the vacancy rate in the second quarter the smallest improvement since early 2010. Reis Inc., which follows the property market for its clients, also reports that demand for office space is slowing somewhat. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even more ominous for long-term growth prospects is the decline in world trade, as recession bites in the eurozone and growth slows in China. The World Trade Organization estimates that the global volume of trade in goods will expand only 2.5 percent this year, half the rate in 2011 and far below the 14 percent chalked up in 2010. Not good news for exporters. Oliver Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, now says, ?It will surely take at least a decade from the beginning of the crisis for the world economy to get back to decent shape.? Since the crisis began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, we have about six years of a non-decent world economy ahead of us. And Americans who are comforted by the fact that we are at least eking out some growth while Europe is in recession might heed the warning of Bill Gross of Pimco, which manages $1.8 trillion in its several funds. He says that America?s reliance on debt is like ?an addict whose habit extends beyond weed or cocaine and who frequently pleasures himself with budgetary crystal meth.? He reckons the U.S. must raise taxes or cut spending to the tune of $1.6 trillion per year, compared with the mere $200 billion in spending cuts and tax increases that would occur if America goes over the ?fiscal cliff? at year end. One way or the other, whether we borrow until the bond vigilantes cry halt, or don the hair shirt of austerity, the outlook is not brilliant.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And yet, and yet. Auto sales continue to boom, rising in September by 12.8 percent over last year, hitting a 4½ year high as consumers continue to trade in their ageing vehicles. The manufacturing sector picked up in September for the first time in four months, and passed the 50-point mark that the Institute for Supply Management sets as the point at which a sector is growing. Both new orders and employment in that sector rose. The housing market continues to recover: prices are rising, new-home sales are about 28 percent higher than last year, and shortages of houses for sale are being reported in some regions. Private equity funds are sitting on $1 trillion, looking for deals, and corporations have a $2 trillion cash hoard, waiting for some clarity as to future tax and regulatory policy (the Republican view) or a government-stimulated increase in consumer demand (the Democrats? Keynesian view). Presumably, the clarity businessmen say they seek will come on November 6, when we will learn whether businesses? failure to invest is due to uncertainty or will be exacerbated by a new certainty: The tax increases and new regulations that President Obama is promising should he return to the White House to finish the job he has described as transforming America.</p>"

But Dickerson is ignoring the fact that Romney running mate Paul Ryan suggested last week that Romney would not reduce the size of his tax cuts because lowering taxes is his highest priority.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion on the presidential debate on <em>Face The Nation</em>, Dickerson said that it was unfair to accuse Romney of being dishonest about his tax plan. Dickerson explained that a top Romney economic adviser ""said we have two goals here. One is deficit reduction, the other is reducing marginal rates. If those come in conflict our primary goal is deficit reduction and the marginal rates might not go down as much.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>That stands in direct contrast to remarks by Paul Ryan, who was asked specifically if Mitt Romney would ""scale back on the 20 percent tax cut for the wealthy"" if the cuts could not be paid for and replied ""No, no."".</p>
<p>Chris Wallace asked Ryan in that September 30 <em>Fox News Sunday</em> interview ""what's most important to [Romney] in his tax reform plan?"" Ryan replied, ""keeping tax rates down.

But the statements from President Obama they are pointing to are true.</p>
<p>John Fund of <em>National Review</em> and Jonathan Karl of ABC News both used factual statements made by President Obama as examples to claim that he ""stretched the truth"" during the October 3 presidential debate. Fund cited Obama's comments about the power of an advisory board created by the health care reform law, while Karl pointed to Obama's statement that he has proposed a $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. In fact, both statements by President Obama during the debate were true, and have been supported by independent fact-checkers.</p>
<p>As a guest on CBS' <em>Face the Nation </em>Fund claimed ""both candidates, I think, told things that stretched the truth."" Fund specifically criticized Obama for saying in the debate that the Independent Payments Advisory Board instituted by the health reform law ""wasn't going to make any decisions on treatment."" According to Fund, that board ""has unilateral power, unless Congress overrides it with a supermajority, to basically tell all doctors and hospitals this is how much money you have to treat people. That is incredible power. That is effectively the power to ration health care. So I think the President was stretching the truth in a big part of Obamacare.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the <a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=9D86F64C-E1F6-5113-51036B3743BD9466"">debate</a>, President Obama disputed Mitt Romney's statement that the health reform law ""put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive."" Obama described the advisory board as ""a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera"" who work ""to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? ... [W]hat this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.""</p>
<p>Obama's description is accurate. The <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3590/text"">health reform law</a> forbids the board from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care ... or otherwise restrict benefits,"" and <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/04/if-the-right-wing-media-are-right-romney-is-in/190345"">multiple fact-checkers</a> have made clear the board ""wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans"" and ""cannot by law make recommendations about what treatments people get."" Instead, according to <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-ipab-board-can-tell-people-ultimately-/"">Politifact</a>, ""it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost.""</p><div class=""feedflare"">

Economists, however, agree that these&nbsp;attacks are&nbsp;baseless&nbsp;and that&nbsp;data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics&nbsp;is accurate.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;guest-hosting&nbsp;Fox News'&nbsp;<em>Your World</em>,&nbsp;Bolling&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;the BLS,&nbsp;which&nbsp;reported this morning&nbsp;that the unemployment rate&nbsp;has&nbsp;dropped from 8.2&nbsp;percent&nbsp;to 7.8&nbsp;percent. Bolling&nbsp;-- whose guest, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, also questioned the BLS data -- cast doubt on&nbsp;the report by repeatedly claiming the numbers&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;""feel right.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bolling went on <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/05/conservative-media-add-obama-donations-to-their/190420"">suggest bias</a> in the BLS by highlighting two employees ""who both have been donors to the Obama campaign"" and asking if we should ""make any assumptions on that."" Welch responded by calling the&nbsp;Labor&nbsp;Department ""ideologues"" and claiming they ""bankrupted the auto industry"" and ""handed the companies over to the unions.""</p>
<p>Later in the segment, Welch said it was a ""coincidence"" that ""one month before the election, we have a number that comes out one-tenth below when the president took office,"" suggesting it came&nbsp;from&nbsp;""an ideologue division of the federal government."" Bolling replied:&nbsp;""I don't believe in coincidence.""</p>
<p>Economic experts, however, have dismissed the type of conspiracy&nbsp;peddling that Bolling engaged in today. In an&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;Salon, economist Justin Wolfers&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/10/05/an_economist_debunks_the_job_truthers/"">pushed back</a>&nbsp;on the attacks:</p><div class=""feedflare"">

But one of the economists Fox identified is no longer a BLS employee, and only a tiny fraction of BLS workers have even made campaign donations.</p>
<p>This morning, BLS released the September <a href=""http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"">jobs report</a> showing that the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.8 percent. It was the <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2012/1005/Jobless-rate-falls-below-8-percent-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-four-years"">first time in nearly four years</a> that the rate has fallen below 8 percent. Media conservatives -- who have a <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/05/phony-conspiracy-conservative-medias-history-of/190383"">history</a> of attempting to negate positive jobs data -- <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/video/2012/10/05/foxs-charles-payne-declares-the-drop-in-the-une/190391"">rushed</a> to <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/05/media-dismiss-drop-in-unemployment-rate-as-gove/190392"">discredit</a> the data, claiming the jobs numbers were ""total pro-Obama propaganda.""</p>
<p>During a segment in which he stressed that Fox News had done its ""homework,"" <em>Your World</em> guest host Eric Bolling named two economists he said work for BLS currently ""who've both been donors to the Obama campaign,"" asking, ""Should I make any assumptions from that?""</p>

Four days on, they are still, and apparently on purpose, sustaining the &ldquo;Romney won big&rdquo; story by furiously making excuses for Obama&rsquo;s poor performance. He didn&rsquo;t do <em>that </em>badly, but listening to Obama himself, his campaign, and his bewildered surrogates the last few days&nbsp;you would think that Obama was utterly destroyed by some kind of evil genius who was equal parts master actor, pathological liar, and bully. You should watch the debate again to see how silly this is. And it&rsquo;s hard to understand why the Democrats continue to advance this story. I bet that if you polled people today about who won and lost the debate, Obama would do even worse than he did in Wednesday night&rsquo;s instant polls, thanks to his and his campaign&rsquo;s continuing self flagellation.</p>

	<p>To listen to some German businessmen singing the praises of the euro, you could be forgiven for thinking that life must have been hell beforehand. In fact, it was just the opposite. It was under the deutschemark that Germany achieved its &#8220;economic miracle&#8221;. True, there was a persistent tendency for the deutschemark to rise. But Germany still tended to run a current account surplus, albeit smaller than today &ndash; less than 1pc of GDP, on average, between 1970 and 1998.

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever heard the term &ldquo;disruptive physician&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why no, I haven't. Please go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; means doing things that would get you fired on the spot if you were a less exalted person than an M.D....When analysts began looking closely at negative patient outcomes, we were all astonished to learn that disruptive physicians were firmly linked to morbidity and mortality.  Put in simplest terms, if Dr. Frankenstein has a habit of verbally abusing the ICU nurse who calls him in the middle of the night about a patient who is not doing well, sooner or later that nurse&rsquo;s subconscious causes her to start taking a more rosy view of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.  Dr. Frankenstein arrives fresh and rested in the morning, but the patient lost too much ground over the night, and oops! there you have it, a negative patient outcome, also called &ldquo;death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how the problem was addressed.  Malpractice insurance underwriters and accrediting bodies require hospitals to have disruptive physician policies that clearly define the prohibited behavior, and to train all staff &ndash; right down to the parking-lot attendants &ndash; every year about what the policy says.  What makes it work is the mandatory-snitch rule.  If said parking lot attendant happens to witness a physician in violation of the policy, the incident must be reported or the attendant&rsquo;s job is on the line.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous: threaten to fire the victims of an abusive bastard if they are too intimidated to stand up for themselves?  But on closer inspection it functions exactly as a good policy should....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heussler suggests that hundreds of people might be unfairly behind bars in Massachusetts because of faked drug tests that would have been prevented with a mandatory snitch rule. If, like me, you've never heard of this before, the whole thing is worth a read.</p>"

As usual in a presidential cycle, there are three categories this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_crystal_ball.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px 20px 15px 30px;"" />Winner and total electoral votes for president.</li>

    <li>Composition of the Senate.  Current composition is 53 D/I, 47 R.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, instead of giving my own projections, I decided to provide an official line as forecast by Sam Wang, this blog's semi-official election forecaster (and winner of the 2008 election pool). Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/2012/10/05/predictions-october-5th-presidentsenate/"" target=""_blank"">President:</a> Obama 332, Romney 206</li>

</ul>
<p>The links take you to Sam's posts, which include error bars and other details. Can you do better than Sam? His presidential forecast sure seems optimistic to me.

<blockquote>
<p>Steep drop in jobless rate has some Obama foes crying foul</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I thought: this is amazing. One tweet from Jack Welch sets off a wingnut firestorm that actually makes the front page of the <em>Times</em>. The power of these guys to set the news agenda is pretty spectacular.</p>
<p>But there may be an unappreciated irony at work here. Although BLS didn't cook the unemployment books, there's no question that the headline number, which is derived from a telephone survey of households, can be fairly noisy from month to month. There was a big spike upward in September's employment figure, and that could be real or it could be a statistical outlier.</p>
<p>Or there might be a third option: In a little-noticed part of yesterday's report, BLS announced that it had <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"" target=""_blank"">systematically undercounted jobs</a> by 386,000 from April 2011 through March 2012. So maybe it's continued to undercount jobs since then, as Karl Smith suggests <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2012/10/05/yeah-so-about-those-400000-jobs/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. If so, then not only is the September number accurate, it's making up for an undercount over the past six months. That's the shaded portion under the red line in the chart below, which is a simple trend line that runs through the revised March 2012 figure and extends it through September. It suggests that the September employment number is right where you'd expect it to be if the economy were continuing a steady but modest recovery&nbsp;&mdash; which seems like a reasonable bet.</p>
<p>So here's the irony: if BLS really has been undercounting, it means that the jobs picture has looked overly gloomy during the first half of the year, <em>which is exactly when it hurt President Obama the worst</em>. What this means is that the wingnuts might be more than merely wrong. They might have things 180 degrees backward. It's quite possible that far from being unfairly favorable toward Obama, the BLS numbers have been unfairly hurting him. September's spike corrected that, but probably too late to do him very much good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama's campaign and Democratic allies raised a record $181 million in September, his campaign manager said today....The Obama campaign manager said the average donation was $53, with 98% of the contributions at $250 or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, I wonder if the Republican focus on Super PACs will end up hurting them? Team Blue might be raising a bit less money overall than Team Red, but the Obama campaign is raising more than the Romney campaign. If you're Karl Rove, I suppose you might argue that Super PACs have more freedom to launch nasty (but effective) attack ads than the campaigns themselves, so it's a good thing that a big chunk of conservative money is going to Crossroads GPS and their ilk. If you're Jim Messina, you'll probably argue that, in the end, it's better to have most of your money under central control, where you can use it precisely the way you need to.</p>
<p>I have no idea which is the better argument. Either way, though, Obama certainly doesn't seem to be having any big problem raising money from the folks who supported him in 2008. I continue to think that Mitt Romney lost a real chance to eat into that support when he decided last spring that he had to continue placating the tea partiers instead of immediately moving to the center.</p>"

<p>The Social Security retirement age is already increasing by statute and will reach 67 in a few years. Apparently Romney wants it to go up to 69 or 70. The actual number he has in mind <a href=""http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security"" target=""_blank"">is unclear</a> (surprise, surprise) but given that he plans to balance Social Security's books <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_life_expectancy_top_bottom.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />solely by raising the retirement age and slowing the growth of benefits for ""those with higher incomes,"" I'd put my money on 70. Slowing benefit growth on high earners just doesn't do enough to let you get away with anything less.</p>
<p>So there you have it. If you're in your 30s or 40s, Mitt Romney thinks you should work until you're 70. That might be OK for bloggers and politicians, but I'm not sure how all the dockworkers and haircutters and grocery clerks are going to feel about that.

<blockquote>
<p>Before it becomes a kind of Fact-Made-Fact-By-Repetition, I'd like to challenge the much-assumed idea that in the first presidential debate Mitt Romney ""moved to the center"" in a real, substantive way. This seems to be the conclusion of many Democrats, many in the MSM, and of those few Republicans who occasionally object to the endless rightward drift of the GOP.</p>
<p>Sure, his rhetoric <em>sounded</em> more moderate. But when you look at the details, nothing changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ed provides chapter and verse in the rest of his post, which is worth a read. But I'd like to add a related thought: relatively speaking, Romney was never all that far to the right in the first place. Sure, he's adopted all the standard positions of the modern tea-party-ized GOP, but during the primaries he was always <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_romney_grimace.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />pretty careful not to go any further than that. On actual policy, he never tried to move to the right of Newt Gingrich or Michele Bachmann or Rick Perry.</p>
<p>What he <em>did</em> do was adopt a ""severely conservative"" rhetorical style, highlighted by his almost comically harsh attacks on Barack Obama. He was content to let the other candidates offer up redder meat than he did, but he always insisted on making sure that everyone knew his contempt for Obama was second to none. At the time, I figured this was deliberate: he didn't want to take any insane positions that might hurt him in the general election, but he still wanted to do something to show tea party voters that he was one of them in his heart. The way he did that was by never letting five minutes go by without launching yet another over-the-top verbal volley against Obama.</p>
<p>And it was a good strategy! It's easy to ditch attacks like that after the primary is over, and for the most part he has. Ever since spring, Romney's schtick has been an almost sorrowful acknowledgment that Obama is a good man, an honorable man, but in over his head. The harshness is mostly gone, and hardly anyone has even noticed that his attacks on Obama changed course rather abruptly as soon as he became the consensus nominee in April. And since then he's also solidified his standing with the tea party base strongly enough that he can get away with some rhetorical concessions on policy as well. This resonates more strongly with the pundit class, but Ed is right: on substance, Romney hasn't changed a thing. He still won't accept a dime in revenue increases; he still plans to cut taxes substantially on the rich while claiming he's doing no such thing; he still wants to voucherize both Medicare and education spending; he still wants to turn Medicaid over to the states and slash its funding; he still wants to increase the defense budget; he still wants to repeal both Obamacare and Dodd-Frank; and he still claims to be a deficit warrior even as he refuses to provide any details about just how he'd actually cut the deficit.</p>
<p>The new, more bipartisan Romney should be taken for what it is: a campaign stratagem, not a real change. He isn't moving to the center, he's just trying to sound like he's moving to the center. My guess is that it won't work, but given the obsession of the Washington press corps with optics and conflict, it might. You never know.</p>"

<p>There's a very sharp, very sudden dropoff in 1994. Just eyeballing it, it looks like there were an average of about 14 attacks per year from 1970-1993 but only six or so from 1994-2010. Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""That follows the trend of terrorism generally,"" says Erin Miller, a research assistant at START who manages the Global Terrorism Database. ""In the early 1990s there's a drop-off worldwide in terrorism against pretty much all target types."" Miller cites the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a subsequent wane in leftist terrorism as one possible explanation for the downturn beginning in the mid-1990s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe! On a broader note, Adam points out that Mitt Romney's tiresome trope about the Benghazi attacks being the result of President Obama's ""weakness"" is just nonsense. There were lots of attacks during the Reagan administration, and many fewer during the Clinton administration. Attacks rose a bit during the Bush administration, and have been a hair lower during the Obama administration. This is almost certainly due to external factors, not to any particular strength or weakness of the presidents themselves.</p>
<p>Still, it's fair to say that the Obama administration has hardly distinguished itself with its curiously meandering response to the Benghazi attacks. I think they've finally given up on the suggestion that it was all because of a YouTube video, but beyond that there's still a fair amount of confusion about who was behind the attack and what the motivation was. Weakness may not have caused the attacks, but until Obama can get his hands around it, it's going to remain a pretty soft spot for the Romney campaign to poke at.</p>"

At the same time, private sector jobs bottomed out at the end of 2009 and have been on a steady upward rise ever since. ""The government sector drag pulls the total down,"" she says, ""which should be appreciated by small-govt loving Republicans."" It should be!

The chart below, which I update monthly, shows net job creation since the beginning of 2008. Those of you with sharp memories will note that the past three months look bluer than they used to. This is because the BLS revised its July and August estimates upward. It's still nothing to write home about, but job creation over the past few months has been a bit healthier than it initially looked.</p>
<p>Politically, this jobs report has something for everyone. The Romney will camp will correctly point out that the recovery remains pretty sluggish. The Obama camp will correctly note that the unemployment rate has now fallen from 9.0% to 7.8% over the past year. The Romney camp will correctly point out that the payroll survey (see chart below) doesn't suggest job creation is really all that robust right now. The Obama camp will simply be happy that the headline unemployment number went down a bunch and the Romney team can no longer chirrup endlessly about ""xx straight months of unemployment above 8%."" You should feel free to adopt your own talking points accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I originally said that the unemployment rate had gone down partly because people were dropping out of the labor force and therefore no longer being counted as unemployed. That was true last month, but not this month. Sorry about that. I've corrected the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wednesday night's debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney underscored a core truth about America's presidential election season: the vast majority of the most consequential policy questions are completely excluded from the process....In part this is because presidential elections are now conducted almost entirely like a tawdry TV reality show....But in larger part, this exclusion is due to the fact that, despite frequent complaints that America is plagued by a lack of bipartisanship, the two major party candidates are in full-scale agreement on many of the nation's most pressing political issues. As a result these are virtually ignored, drowned out by a handful of disputes that the parties relentlessly exploit to <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_debate_lehrer_2012_10_03.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />galvanise their support base and heighten fear of the other side.</p>
<p>Most of what matters in American political life is nowhere to be found in its national election debates. Penal policies vividly illustrate this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Damn. Even Glenn is talking about the debate. He thinks that allowing third-party candidates to participate would ""highlight just how similar Democrats and Republicans have become, and what little choice American voters actually have on many of the most consequential policies."" Maybe. But keep in mind that the topics of last night's debate were chosen in advance by Jim Lehrer. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Economy &ndash; I</li>
    <li>The Economy &ndash; II</li>
    <li>The Economy &ndash; III</li>
    <li>Health Care</li>
    <li>The Role of Government</li>
    <li>Governing</li>
</ul>
<p>Penal policy wasn't there, so it wouldn't really matter much if Gary Johnson had been on the stage. The problem here was the moderator, not the two-party system.</p>
<p>However, there will be a stronger case for a third-party presence in the next debate, which includes foreign policy topics. Even if Candy Crowley sticks to the big-ticket topics &mdash; Iran, Afghanistan, China, etc. &mdash; a third-party candidate like Johnson would have genuinely different things to say. At the same time, I wouldn't expect too much from this. Ron Paul participated in all of the Republican primary debates, and he didn't noticeably move the public opinion needle on foreign policy issues. I'm not sure Gary Johnson would either.</p>
<p>Still, maybe he should have a chance to try. So here's a question for the hivemind: what's fair here? The current threshold is that candidates have to score at least 15% in selected polls to be invited to the debates, and this year no one has qualified. <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/155537/little-support-third-party-candidates-2012-election.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Gary Johnson is around 3% nationally</a>. But maybe that's the wrong threshold. I'm violently opposed to a really small threshold, like 1% or so, because it has the potential to turn the debates into a circus. (Well, more of a circus.) The public really does deserve to get a good close look at the two major-party candidates, since one of them is certain to win the election, and having half a dozen true-believing obsessives on stage doesn't help that.</p>
<p>So here's another idea: the debates should always feature three candidates. Two of them would be the major party candidates and the third would be whoever polls the best among all the minor party candidates. If there were literally no minor party candidates who even appeared on enough state ballots to be serious contenders, then maybe we'd be stuck with two debaters after all. Otherwise, though, we'd always make room for at least one more. Maybe the debate commission would commission its own polls, or maybe it would rely on existing polls. Either way, it would publish the ground rules, and a week before the first debate it would announce who the best performing third-party candidate was.</p>
<p>This system has the virtue of ensuring that the non-mainstream has at least some representation, but without turning the debates into a free-for-all. Comments?</p>"

I didn't quite see it that way. Obama was indeed halting and unfocused, which made him appear oddly unprepared, but I thought Romney's speaking style featured some equally unattractive qualities, ones we've seen in prior debates: he was nervously aggressive, spouted faux outrage over every single claim about his plans, repeatedly demanded more time to respond, and just generally oozed a sort of ADHD quality. Apparently, though, this bothers me more than most people.</p>
<p>But Obama's lack of focus bothered me too. For example, on three different occasions he claimed that Romney wanted to cut taxes by $5 trillion, and three times <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-in-denver-on-oct-3-running-transcript/2012/10/03/24d6eb6e-0d91-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_print.html"" target=""_blank"">Romney said that was wrong:</a></p>

<p>Governor Romney&rsquo;s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut....</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut....</p>
<p>If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion....</p>
<p>Let me repeat what I said. I&rsquo;m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That&rsquo;s not my plan....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is puzzling. The obvious gimmick here is to repeatedly refer to Romney's plan as a $5 trillion tax cut, which is sort of brazenly incorrect, as a way of baiting Romney into claiming that he's going to close loopholes and deductions that will make his plan revenue neutral. And it worked! That's exactly what Romney did.</p>
<p>This is a pretty good trap. After getting Romney to talk about deductions and loopholes on three separate occasions, it's the perfect time to make a withering comment about pigs in a poke and demand that he come clean. Is he going to do away with the home mortgage deduction? The charitable deduction? The healthcare deduction? &nbsp;<em>Come on, Governor Romney, level with us. No more snow jobs. Let's hear your real plan, not a bunch of supply-side happy talk.</em></p>
<p>It was perfect! Except that Obama never sprung the trap. Oh, he talked about ""the math,"" and about the ""analysts"" who say Romney's plan doesn't add up, and later on even got off a quip about Romney's ""secret plans."" But he never even tried to seriously hammer Romney on the point he was obviously setting up: <em>What are the deductions you're targeting? No more hiding. No more secrets. Tell us the other half of your plan.</em></p>
<p>This, to me, was the most peculiar single aspect of the debate. It seemed obvious that this was the road Obama was trying to lead Romney down, and it worked. But then he failed to follow up with the killing blow. Why?</p>"

I'll chalk that up to Sullivan's mercurial temperament, but now that I'm listening to the talking heads, it seems like there's a pretty fair consensus that Obama lost by a bunch. I'll stick to my guns on this: I think Obama lost by a little, but not by much.</p>
<p>Matt Yglesias tweets: ""It's interesting that conservatives who think they don't want Mitt to pivot to the center are clearly elated when he did it and it worked."" That's true. Romney repeatedly noted that he agreed with Obama on various issues and repeatedly took rhetorically moderate positions. For example: ""Regulation is essential. You can&rsquo;t have a free market work if you don&rsquo;t have regulation."" You sure wouldn't have heard him say that during one of the primary debates.</p>
<p>I didn't see this myself, but <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_10/spin_room040284.php"" target=""_blank"">Ed Kilgore</a> reports that the CBS&nbsp;instapoll has Romney winning by 46-22. Ouch. Looks like the talking heads called it better than me.</p>
<p>Noodling a little more about this, I think my disagreement with the media consensus is more over Romney's performance than Obama's. I agree that Obama didn't bring his A game. But I didn't think Romney was all that good either. Yes, he attacked, but he did it in a curiously hyperactive way, constantly insisting on getting in one more rebuttal and then using it to go over <em>every single</em> point that Obama had just made. I thought that was both confusing and exhausting. Romney also made frequent references to things that Beltway junkies understand but ordinary viewers probably didn't. The ""accounting treatment"" for oil companies, for example, or jumping into a point about Dodd-Frank without explaining what Dodd-Frank is. And for what it's worth, I suspect that Romney won't do well in the post-debate fact checks either. It won't be the disaster that Paul Ryan's convention speech was, but he seemed pretty clearly a little faster and looser with the truth than Obama was.</p>"

Neither Romney nor Obama seemed entirely comfortable. Romney struck me as too hyper, insisting in every segment on going over every single claim Obama had just made. The result was a bunch of laundry lists that never cohered into recognizable points. Obama seemed oddly hesitant and halting, as if he wasn't quite sure what points he wanted to make. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-in-denver-on-oct-3-running-transcript/2012/10/03/24d6eb6e-0d91-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_print.html"" target=""_blank"">Transcript here.</a></p>
<p>Neither candidate landed any serious blows. Obama came the closest, I thought, in the last half hour when he attacked Romney for all his secret plans. After noting that Romney wouldn't tell us which tax deductions he wants to cut, or how he wants to replace either Obamacare or Dodd-Frank, Obama delivered the best line of the night: ""Is the reason that Governor <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_debate_obama_2012_10_03.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />Romney is keeping all these plans secret because they&rsquo;re <em>too good</em>? Is it because somehow middle-class families are going to benefit <em>too much</em> from them?""</p>
<p>Did that make up for the fact that Obama was strangely incompetent at attacking Romney on his tax plan in the first half hour? Hard to say. But honestly, going after Romney on the tax deduction front seems pretty obvious, and I don't understand why Obama never really did it. Sure, he made a crack about ""the math,"" but he didn't come straight out and ask Romney if he planned to get rid of the home mortgage deduction, for example. That would have hit home a lot harder than hauling out a wonkish point about the ""independent analysts"" who say Romney's plan doesn't add up.</p>
<p>Romney avoided any big mistakes, and certainly projected more energy than Obama. But I didn't think he really delivered any great lines, or got off any really crisp explanations of his policies. I don't think tonight's performance will hurt him, but I doubt that it really helps him either.</p>
<p>Final score: I give Obama a B-, Romney a B.</p>
<hr width=""25%"" />
<p>Forget all that newfangled Twitter nonsense. We're going retro with some old school liveblogging of tonight's debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>10:24 -</strong> Lehrer: ""We've lost a pod.""</p>
<p><strong>10:23 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney is seriously rambling on education.</p>
<p><strong>10:22 -</strong>&nbsp;Obama keeps pulling back when he's obviously about to attack Romney. Not sure why.</p>
<p><strong>10:21 -</strong>&nbsp;No zingers so far. A few obviously canned lines, but nothing delivered with any zest.</p>
<p><strong>10:16 -</strong> ""I love great schools."" Uh huh. ""I reject the idea that I don&rsquo;t believe in great teachers."" Oh please. The faux outrage doesn't work here.</p>
<p><strong>10:15 -</strong> Obama's tic of constantly saying ""What I've said is...."" is annoying.</p>
<p><strong>10:13 - </strong>So Lehrer's approach for every topic is to ask the candidates if they think there are any differences between them? This really isn't working. It's just an invitation to give a stump speech.</p>
<p><strong>10:12 -</strong> Romney is answering with a bunch of possible options? Weak. Now retreating to talking points.</p>
<p><strong>10:11 -</strong> Ah, finally the attack on details. Romney won't tell us what deductions he'll cut. He won't tell us what he'll replace Dodd-Frank with. He won't tell us what he'll replace Obamacare with. ""Is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret because they're <em>too good</em>?"" Very good line.</p>
<p><strong>10:04 -</strong>&nbsp;Obama's IPAB explanation wasn't bad, but his speech is oddly halting and staccato tonight. He just doesn't seem fully in command of what he wants to say.</p>
<p><strong>10:03 -</strong> ""We didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare."" Oops.</p>
<p><strong>10:01 -</strong> ""The irony is that we&rsquo;ve seen this model work really well &mdash; in Massachusetts."" Good line.</p>
<p><strong>9:59 -</strong> ""Let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did."" Finally! Now let's see if he does a good job.</p>
<p><strong>9:54 -</strong>&nbsp;Starting to think that the old 60-second limits were a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>9:53 -</strong>&nbsp;Do most viewers know what Dodd-Frank is? Do they know what leverage limits are?</p>
<p><strong>9:47 -</strong> Obama's attack on vouchers is fairly effective. ""If you&rsquo;re 54 or 55, you might want to listen &lsquo;cause this will affect you.""</p>
<p><strong>9:44 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney's attack on the $716 billion that Obama cuts from Medicare was OK, but he should have stuck with it instead of flitting around to whatever other attack popped into his mind.</p>
<p><strong>9:43 -</strong>&nbsp;Obama is right that Social Security needs nothing more than modest tweaks.</p>
<p><strong>9:40 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney is all over the map trying to respond to every last thing Obama said.</p>
<p><strong>9:38 - </strong>""It's actually an accounting treatment...."" That's really not a good phrase to come out of Romney's mouth.</p>
<p><strong>9:36 -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;So far, neither of these guys has really done a crisp job of explaining their programs.</p>
<p><strong>9:34 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney going all in on the dynamic scoring fairy.</p>
<p><strong>9:33 - </strong>""You&rsquo;ve been president four years. You said you&rsquo;d cut the deficit in half. It&rsquo;s now four years later."" That's a good line.</p>
<p><strong>9:27 -</strong> ""I&rsquo;m going to stop the subsidy to PBS""? Seriously? ""I like PBS. I love Big Bird. Actually I like you, too."" Come on.</p>
<p><strong>9:25 -&nbsp;</strong>Romney's habit of arguing about how much time he has is something he really needs to overcome. Sounds childish.</p>
<p><strong>9:20 -</strong>&nbsp;Nope, no pushback on loopholes.</p>
<p><strong>9:18 -</strong> Is this $5 trillion tax cut thing a trap for Romney? Now Obama can ask him to list the loophole disclosures to pay for that $5 trillion.</p>
<p><strong>9:15 -</strong>&nbsp;Are these guys <em>trying</em> to be soporific?</p>
<p><strong>9:09 -</strong>&nbsp;A pair of stump speeches. I've forgotten what they said already.</p>
<p><strong>9:01</strong> - CNN has voter reaction in real time! Squiggly lines!</p>
<p><strong>8:58 -</strong> David Gergen says it's all about who's ""looser."" That's bad news already for Romney.</p>"

She has three reasons, and the first two boil down to the fact that Republicans aren't likely to suddenly stop being crazy just because we had an election, even if Obama wins.<sup>1</sup> I can buy that. <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/03/over-the-fiscal-cliff-by-hugo-first-and-betty-wont/"" target=""_blank"">But here's reason #3:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, I&rsquo;m somewhat skeptical that Democrats would have the political fortitude to go over the cliff.  Democrats could have stuck to their guns in the lame duck of 2010, forcing Republicans (still in the minority) to swallow an increase in upper income tax rates as the price for extending the middle class tax cuts.  That&rsquo;s not the strategy Democrats chose then, and it strikes me as equally unlikely in 2012 with a GOP House majority.  Going over the cliff requires Democrats to take ownership of raising taxes on the middle class at Christmas.  That might be the strategically wise move for bolstering Democrats&rsquo; leverage come January.  But it also strikes me as an electorally doubtful holiday gift to voters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not so sure about that. In this case, I think I'm with the folks who like to refer to this event as a fiscal slope rather than a fiscal cliff. Their general point is that we don't all suddenly pay thousands of dollars in taxes and cut billions of dollars in spending at the stroke of midnight on January 1st. This stuff all phases in over time.</p>
<p>That's true, and I doubt very much that there would be any serious consequences to doing a deal in February or March instead of December. In the particular case of taxes, the only thing that happens on January 1st is that withholding rates would go up slightly &mdash; and maybe not even that. The IRS has a fair amount of latitude to leave withholding rates alone for a few months if it wants to. Either way, this means that Democrats don't really have to worry about ""owning"" the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for quite a while. (The payroll tax holiday also expires on December 31, but that was always unlikely to be extended anyway. It doesn't have much to do with the fiscal cliff.)</p>
<p>For a few months, then, taxpayers won't see much impact. Maybe none at all. As a result, I think Democrats could pretty safely stick to their guns and extend negotiations into 2013 without much risk. At that point, with the Bush tax cuts gone and rates back up to their Clinton-era levels, they'll still have to convince Republicans to introduce a bill that cuts only the middle-income rates, not the top marginal rates, and that won't be easy. But Republicans will be under as much pressure as Democrats by that point, and they might very well be willing to do a deal.</p>
<p>In short, as long as the composition of Congress doesn't change dramatically, I don't think the calculus is much different before and after January 1st. The cliff doesn't really start to get scary until later in the year.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>This entire post is predicated on the likelihood that Obama will win reelection and the House will remain fairly solidly in Republican hands. If either of those doesn't happen, the legislative calculus changes completely.</p>"

Yesterday Mitt Romney told a Denver TV station that he had some new ideas about his plan to reduce tax deductions in order to make up for the <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/romney-suggests-uniform-tax-break-possibly-17000/story?id=17374494#.UGyPE0YS7Tr"" target=""_blank"">20% across-the-board rate cuts he's promised:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an option you could say everybody's going to get up to a $17,000 deduction; and you could use your charitable deduction, your home mortgage deduction, or others &mdash;&nbsp;your healthcare deduction. And you can fill that <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_show_math.jpg"" style=""margin: 20px 10px 15px 30px;"" />bucket, if you will, that $17,000 bucket that way. And higher income people might have a lower number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't commented on this yet for several reasons. First, it was casually tossed out. It's not clear if Romney is serious about this. Second, it's a little unclear exactly what he meant: a $17,000 max on deductions from your gross income, or a $17,000 max on how much your tax bill can be reduced? Third, it's still missing crucial details. When Romney says ""healthcare deduction,"" is he talking about the exclusion of healthcare benefits from your taxable income? Is that $17,000 cap for single filers or couples? Does it include the personal exemption and dependent exemptions? Etc. Fourth, he didn't provide a number for higher income people, just a hint that it might be lower than $17,000. Fifth, there's no telling how the math works out on this.</p>
<p>The first four of these things require more detail from Romney. The fifth requires an analysis from the Tax Policy Center or some similar outfit. In the meantime, there's not a lot of point in commenting on something with so many missing pieces.</p>
<p>So for now I'll limit myself to saying that it's highly unlikely that the math works out here. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/romney-just-quietly-announced-a-good-tax-policy-idea.html"" target=""_blank"">Josh Barro</a> thinks that virtually everyone making under $200,000 would see either a net tax decrease or no change at all under this proposal. And we already know that even if every single deduction for those making over $200,000 were completely eliminated, <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/10/251-165-0-0"" target=""_blank"">they'd see a net tax decrease too.</a> So no matter how Romney fills in the blanks, this would amount to a net tax decrease. There's just no way that it becomes revenue neutral, as Romney has promised, without a massive sprinkling of dynamic scoring fairy dust.</p>"

I was going to do it anyway because Nicholas Beaudrot told me to, <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_08/014294.php"" target=""_blank"">so here it is:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of a ""statistical tie"" is based on the theory that (a) statistical results are credible only if they are at least 95% certain to be accurate, and (b) any lead less than a poll's margin of error is less than 95% certain.</p>
<p>There are two problems with this: first, 95% is not some kind of magic cutoff point, and second, the idea that the MOE represents 95% certainty is wrong anyway. A poll's MOE does represent a 95% confidence interval for each individual's percentage, but it doesn't represent a 95% confidence for the <em>difference</em> between the two, and that's what we're really interested in.</p>
<p>In fact, what we're really interested in is the probability that the difference is greater than zero &mdash; in other words, that one candidate is genuinely ahead of the other. But this probability isn't a cutoff, it's a continuum: the bigger the lead, the more likely that someone is ahead and that the result isn't just a polling fluke. So instead of lazily reporting any result within the MOE as a ""tie,"" which is statistically wrong anyway, it would be more informative to just go ahead and tell us how probable it is that a candidate is really ahead. Here's a table that gives you the answer to within a point or two:</p>
<img align=""middle"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_moe_2008.gif"" style=""margin: 3px 0px 5px 75px;"" />
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty handy, no? Most national polls have an MOE of about 3%, so you can usually just use that row. NBC, for example, <a href=""http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14186700-nbcwsj-poll-obama-maintains-lead-but-romney-within-striking-distance"" target=""_blank"">puts Obama ahead of Romney right now by 49-46%.</a> So what are the odds that Obama is really ahead, and this isn't just a statistical fluke? Answer:&nbsp;84%.</p>
<p>But now for the bad news: As fun as it is to haul this thing out every few years, it's obsolete. If you want to know who's ahead, there are now loads of sites that aggregate multiple polls in various ways to provide estimates with far less margin of error than any single poll. If Pollster or RCP says that Obama is ahead by three points, then the odds are that he really is ahead by three points. There's still plenty of room for various kinds of error in these poll-of-polls averages, but pure sample error isn't really one of them any more.</p>
<p>For the record, as of today Pollster has Obama ahead by 4.3%; RCP has Obama ahead by 4.0%; Sam Wang's meta-margin has Obama ahead by 5.06%; and Nate Silver has Obama ahead by 3.9%. I think it's pretty safe to say that, at this moment in time, Obama is comfortably ahead.</p>"

What's more, he says, recent studies suggest that <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/swing-voters-climate-change-issue"" target=""_blank"">climate can even be a winning political issue:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first of these studies emerged in 2011 from Stanford pollster Jon Krosnick and his colleagues....Both Democrats and independents strongly favored a green candidate over a neutral one, while for Republicans it was basically a wash&mdash;neither a pro or anti-climate candidate moved them much. ""By taking a green position on climate, candidates of either party can gain votes,"" Krosnick's team concluded.</p>
<p>....Their findings were reinforced earlier this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason who, in a March 2012 survey, similarly found that taking a stand on climate has the potential to motivate Democratic and independent voters, without causing damage among Republicans.</p>
<p>.... In a survey of 1,204 likely voters in May of 2012, [Andrew] Maxfield found that a ""clean energy"" candidate fared better than an ""all-of-the-above"" candidate who supported a variety of energy choices&mdash;coal, drilling, and also clean energy. Maxfield then went on to test a variety of climate messages&mdash;and the upshot, he says, is that ""if you feel strongly about climate change, there is a way to talk about it that voters will understand and appreciate""&mdash;especially if candidates focus on recent extreme weather. ""I was surprised at the strength of that, and the extent to which voters had begun to recognize the severe weather, and experience it,"" Maxfield says.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I remain skeptical. In a vacuum, supporting green policies has always been a popular position. And it's always been true that there are good ways to talk about climate change and bad ways. I'm not sure anything big has changed here.</p>
<p>The problem is that you don't always get to talk about political issues the way you want to. Your opponents get to talk about them too. And they won't be shy about labeling virtually any serious green policy as a price hike for consumers and a regulatory burden for business. What's more, conservatives have an unusual advantage when they say this: it's actually true. Things like carbon taxes and cap-and-trade policies really will increase the price of energy for consumers. That's the whole point. Conversely, if you limit yourself to generally popular issues like CAFE standards and building more solar plants in the desert, voters will support it, but only because the price hike is small enough (and hidden enough) that it has only a modest impact on climate change in the first place.</p>
<p>What really matters, then, is what happens when potential voters are presented with messaging from both sides. To get an idea of how effective this is, take a look at the <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/153608/Global-Warming-Views-Steady-Despite-Warm-Winter.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Gallup polls below.</a> The first poll asks people if the threat of global warming is generally exaggerated or not, and it hits bottom in 2006, at about the time of the release of Al Gore's <em>An Inconvenient Truth.</em> Then it starts to rise as conservatives fight back, reaching a peak in 2010, shortly after the release of the ""Climategate"" emails. It's gone down since then, which is good news, but it's still way higher than it was even five years ago. Likewise, the bottom chart shows that even Democrats and Independents are far more likely to think that news of global warming is exaggerated than they were back in 2006.</p>
<p>So there's a long way to go before public opinion is anywhere near where it needs to be. We need to get to a point where even if people know that it means an increase in gasoline and electricity prices &mdash; <em>even if their noses are rubbed in it</em> &mdash; they still support serious green policies. This is the work ahead of us.</p>

<ol>
<li>Income inequality goes up.</li>
    <li>As a result, earnings of the middle class become sluggish....</li>
    <li>And earnings of the rich skyrocket, a trend reinforced by lower tax rates on both labor and capital income.</li>
    <li>Rich people eventually run out of sensible things to invest all this money in (because consumer demand is sluggish, see #2), so they get stupid.</li>
    <li>Stupid money finances stupid loans to middle-class borrowers who can't afford them (because their incomes are sluggish, see #2).</li>

<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_wall_street_fallen_bull.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 15px 10px 15px 30px;"" />This all works great until it doesn't. When it doesn't, the economy goes kablooey.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the aughts, #5 took the form of increasing corruption in the mortgage loan market and increasingly baroque Wall Street financial concoctions to package up all those corrupt loans. It worked great for about five or six years, followed by a Wile E. Coyote moment where the economy was suspended in limbo for a year or so, followed by an epic crash that we still haven't dug our way out of.</p>
<p>I'm just a blogger, though, so there's no special reason you should take me seriously. However, a reader alerted me to a recent <em>National Journal</em> piece by Jonathan Rauch that suggests this theory is <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/essay-the-growing-income-gap-in-the-u-s-harms-the-economy-20120927"" target=""_blank"">gaining ground among serious economists:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once in a while, a new economic narrative gives renewed strength to an old political ideology. Two generations ago, supply-side economics transformed conservatism&rsquo;s case against big government from a merely ideological claim to an economic one....Something potentially analogous is stirring among the Left. An emerging view holds that inequality has reached levels that are damaging not only to liberals&rsquo; sense of justice but to the economy&rsquo;s stability and growth. If this narrative catches on, it could give the egalitarian Left new purchase in the national economic debate.</p>
<p>....As Christopher Brown, an economist at Arkansas State University, put it in a pioneering 2004 paper, &ldquo;Income inequality can exert a significant drag on effective demand.&rdquo; Looking back on the two decades before 1986, Brown found that <strong>if the gap between rich and poor hadn&rsquo;t grown wider, consumption spending would have been almost 12 percent higher than it actually was.</strong></p>
<p>....So inequality might suppress growth. It might also cause instability. In a democracy, politicians and the public are unlikely to accept depressed spending power if they can help it....They might, for example, create policies allowing banks to write flimsy home mortgages and encouraging consumers to seek them....That is not a bad description of what happened in the 1920s and again during these past few years. <strong>&ldquo;When&mdash;as appears to have happened in the long run-up to both crises&mdash;the rich lend a large part of their added income to the poor and middle class, and when income inequality grows for several decades,&rdquo;</strong> the IMF&rsquo;s Michael Kumhof and Romain Ranci&egrave;re wrote, &ldquo;debt-to-income ratios increase sufficiently to raise the risk of a major crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But wait. Which is it? Does inequality depress demand? Or does it inflate credit bubbles that maintain demand? Unfortunately, the answer can be both. If inequality is severe enough, there could be enough of it to cause the country to inflate a dangerous credit bubble and still not offset the reduction in demand.</p>
<p>And, no, we&rsquo;re not finished. Inequality may also be destabilizing in another way. &ldquo;Of every dollar of real income growth that was generated between 1976 and 2007,&rdquo; Rajan wrote, &ldquo;58 cents went to the top 1 percent of households.&rdquo; In other words, for decades, more than half of the increase in the country&rsquo;s GDP poured into the bank accounts of the richest Americans, who needed liquid investments in which to put their additional wealth. <strong>Their appetite for new investment vehicles fueled a surge in what Arkansas State&rsquo;s Brown calls &ldquo;financial engineering&rdquo;&mdash;the concoction of exotic financial instruments, which acted on the financial sector like steroids.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole thing is worth a read. This model of inequality and financial crises has some powerful proponents, but it's hardly a mainstream consensus at this point. It's worth keeping an eye on, though. There might be some serious explanatory power here.</p>"

In the wake of the disastrous attacks on American interests in North Africa on 9/11/2012, the Obama regime seems to have engaged in a calculated policy of disinformation to hide the magnitude of their failure from the Congress and the public. Now, in an attempt to keep the lie alive, they are claiming they were ill-served by the US intelligence community.<div class=""feedflare"">

In an effort to bolster his image, his regime went about knocking over doddering, toothless autocrats as a way of proving his toughness. They didn't give much thought to who would succeed them.

Look to Germany, Boston College professor Kent Greenfield <a href=""http://www.democracyjournal.org/26/the-stakeholder-strategy.php?page=all"">argues</a> in the latest issue of <em>Democracy</em>.</p> <p>Through a process called ?codetermination,? large German companies are required to elect half their board of directors by a vote of their employees, rather than of their shareholders. And it?s ?now the economic powerhouse of Europe,? Greenfield contends.</p> <p>How much the latter is true is pretty arguable. Germany does not have the kind of widespread unemployment that plagues the rest of the continent, but it also has much more <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/09/25/german_wage_stagnation_is_it_the_real_secret_to_their_employment_success_.html"">severe wage stagnation</a>. So it?s hardly a paradise. But Greenfield?s piece raises a good question: What have the results of codetermination been for Germany, both for growth and for workers? share of that growth?</p> <p>The best research on this in English-language publications has come from John Addison of the University of South Carolina. He, along with Claus Schnabel and Joachim Wagner, recently produced a <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=446402"">literature review</a> summarizing all 17 studies that have been conducted on codetermination to date. There have been three stages of research, each using better data than the last, but the most recent is almost uniformly positive toward the councils.</p> <p>While there?s little evidence that they increase sales or overall employment, they do seem to have a positive effect on productivity, according to the two most recent studies on that question. One, from <a href=""http://wiwi.uni-paderborn.de/dep1/organisations-medienoekonomie-prof-dr-frick/team/prof-dr-bernd-frick/"">Bernd Frick</a>, found that Western German firms saw a huge 25 percent spike in productivity, while Eastern German firms transitioning out of Communism saw an even bigger 30 percent jump. Previous research almost uniformly found that the councils increase wages.</p> <p>That said, some suggested that the effects on productivity are blunted for small firms, or those without unions. Addison and his coauthors do urge skepticism of the more recent productivity numbers, noting that getting a good sample for comparisons is tough.

While that usually works out fine for large employers, who can spread the costs among a big pool of employees, it could cause costs to spike for a smaller company. For that reason, only about 10 percent of firms with fewer than 200 employees self-insure ? but that number<a href=""http://www.ebri.org/pdf/FFE114.11Feb09.Final.pdf"" target=""_blank""> rises</a> to 89 percent among firms with more than 5,000 employees. </p> <p>Many companies that self-insure also buy ?stop loss? insurance, meant to protect again unpredictable, especially catastrophic events ? the possibility, for example, that a number of employees need an expensive surgery at the exact same time.</p> <p>The Affordable Care Act exempts self-insured plans from a number of mandates: They don?t have to pay <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/28/pf/taxes/health_reform_new_taxes/index.htm"">an excise tax</a> if they provide more expensive benefits and don?t have to adhere <a href=""http://www.uhc.com/united_for_reform_resource_center/health_reform_provisions/medical_loss_ratio.htm"">to the 80/20 rule</a>, which requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical costs. </p> <p>Laszewski wonders whether a free pass from those benefits might push small businesses to get a bit riskier.</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The ability of small employers to in effect opt-out of the ACA?s stiffest insurance reform requirements by moving to self-insurance is on the cusp of becoming a market trend. Some insurers are offering to take over the liability for individual health insurance claims (the ?attachment point?) as low as $10,000 in the very small employer health insurance market??the employer is on the hook for claim costs below that point. </p> <p>Regulators are worried about self-selection in the market??the healthiest small groups going self-insured and refusing to be part of the ACA?s insurance exchange pool leaving only the sickest small groups to fall under the ACA.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Laszewski runs through a few ways that state legislatures could blunt this change, namely by raising that ?attachment point? higher and higher. California<a href=""http://www.locktonhealthreformblog.com/healthreform/2012/04/california-bill-seeks-to-curtail-use-of-stop-loss-insurance-by-small-self-funded-health-plans/"">, for example, has looked at</a> legislation that wouldn?t allow stop-loss insurance to kick in until $95,000 in claims per employee have been paid out. The stop loss insurance I mentioned earlier would only kick in after the employer has paid tens of thousands of dollars in claims.</p> <p>That would make the move towards self-insurance, even with the freedom from mandates it offers, a significantly riskier proposal.</p> <p></p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/243575d4/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544471442/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/243575d4/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544471442/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/243575d4/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544471442/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/243575d4/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

After all, who <em>doesn?t</em> love a good study showing that a peek at adorable kitten pics <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/01/want-to-increase-your-productivity-study-says-look-at-this-adorable-kitten/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein"">can amp up your productivity</a> at work?</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://blog.washingtonpost.com/story-lab/,DanaInfo%3Dmerlin.washpost.com%2BX00026_9.JPG"" /> </p> </p> <p>But now comes a brand-new <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0044275"">paper</a> in the <em>Public Library of Science</em> suggesting that? well, that we should all be wary of hot new research that?s trumpeted by the press. This isn?t an argument against science. The scientific process works quite well in sifting strong claims from weak ones. The problem, it turns out, is that the media tends to over-emphasize exciting new findings while rarely following up to see whether those conclusions have been re-affirmed or debunked later on.</p> <p>To see this, the authors, led by François Gonon of the University of Bordeaux, looked at 47 different scientific publications on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) published during the 1990s, and then went through 347 English-language newspaper articles covering the research. From there, they culled the top ten papers and looked at the coverage. And what they found was stunning.</p> <p>Those ten papers on ADHD received an outpour of press coverage?223 newspaper articles written in the sample. That?s not surprising, since most of them were advancing new hypotheses about ADHD. But those ten studies <em>also</em> generated a lot of follow-up research. In all, there were at least 67 follow-up biomedical studies that ended up either debunking or weakening most of the initial research. Yet newspapers were much less thorough in covering these subsequent papers?the debunking work generated just 57 newspaper articles.</p> <p>There?s a clear imbalance here, note Gonon and his colleagues. The biomedical papers that get the most attention are often the most novel, finding some unexpected effect or testing new hypotheses. But, precisely because they are so novel, they?re more likely to be untrue. That would be fine, except newspapers tend to highlight the initial studies while paying less attention to the party-pooping follow-ups.</p> <p>Part of the problem, too, is with the journals themselves. Those thrilling initial studies tend to get published in the most prestigious medical journals, like <em>Lancet</em> or the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, whereas the follow-ups are often confined to less-visible outlets that few reporters read.</p> <p>The study doesn?t say whether this press bias occurs in other areas of coverage, such as economics or political science. We?ll need?yes?follow-ups to Gonon?s research! But let?s assume this is a widespread problem. Is there an easy solution? That?s less clear.</p> <p>After all, it?s great when an organization like the <a href=""http://www.nas.edu/"">National Academies of Science</a> or the <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> can write up a big, thorough overview of a scientific topic, sifting through many studies in order to judge claims and counterclaims. Those assessments are a good antidote to relying on a single, much-hyped new paper on a topic. But those thorough assessments don?t come along very often?the IPCC, for instance, typically takes five or six years to release its updated reports on the state of climate science.</p> <p>The Economist, which <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21563275?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/journalistic_deficit_disorder"">has a good write-up</a> of Gonon?s paper, offers this common-sense advice: ?The matter goes beyond simply not believing what you read in the newspapers. Rather, it is a question of remembering that if you do not read subsequent confirmation, then the original conclusion may have fallen by the wayside.? And over at the New York Times, Andrew Revkin <a href=""http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/from-abstract-to-news-release-to-story-a-tilt-to-the-front-page-thought/"">has a fascinating post</a> wrestling with the difficulty that science reporters face in conveying the complexity of new scientific research without making their coverage too boring. </p> <p>In any case, Gonon?s study offers a good cautionary tale. Academic research is fascinating! But it?s important to check up on what follow up studies say?those tedious-sounding papers languishing in B-list journals that find no effect for a clever new medical treatment is probably worth a blog post. (And yes, we?ll be sure to keep an eye out for whether anyone comes along with a study that debunks Gonon?s findings?)</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-worlds-most-boring-journal--and-why-its-good-for-science/2012/03/01/gIQAwZf4kR_blog.html"">The world?s most boring journal?and why it?s good for science.</a> </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24303bc1/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544382073/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24303bc1/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544382073/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24303bc1/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544382073/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24303bc1/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

But male employment has also recovered at a faster pace. At their lowest point of employment in early 2010, men had 6.1 million fewer jobs than in January 2007, and they?ve now regained 3 million, or nearly 50 percent, of those jobs since then, according to the Institute for Women?s Policy Research. </p> <p>By contrast, women have lost fewer jobs than men?both in real and relative terms?but it?s taken them longer to recover. Since the beginning of the recession, they?ve regained 1.2 million, or 46 percent, of the total jobs they?ve lost since their lowest employment in the recession, in September 2010. That?s in part because women hold a disproportionate number of public-sector jobs, as Dana Goldstein has <a href=""http://www.danagoldstein.net/dana_goldstein/2011/02/the-wisconsin-labor-fight-an-attack-on-women-too.html"">pointed out</a>, which were aided temporarily through the stimulus but which have been slower to come back than the private sector.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/women-jobs.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>In recent months, however, women?s employment has begun to accelerate.

Paul Leigh at the University of California in Davis has taken one of the most in depth ? and most recent ? <a href=""http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/6969"">looks</a> at what doctors earn. He finds that over a lifetime, a primary care doctor can expect to make $1.5 million less than a medical school classmate who goes into specialty care ? and $2.8 million less than a doctor in the best-paid specialty, neurological surgery.</p> <p>Here?s the full chart of how the earnings of various doctors stack up:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/docpay.png""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/docpay.png"" /> </p> <br /> </a>This aligns with <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/success-of-health-reform-hinges-on-hiring-30000-primary-care-doctors-by-2015/2012/02/06/gIQAnslQ4Q_story.html"">previous research</a> that has also shown a big pay gap between primary care doctors and specialists. (There is some variation, though, which may be a product of certain studies not accounting for variables like gender and payment during residency, which tends to be lower).</p> <p>One big question this study raises is: How much does the pay gap matter to medical students? Research from the Graham Center found, perhaps surprisingly, that it might not factor in as much as we thought: Having higher student debt actually correlates with a higher likelihood of pursuing a primary care career. Debt-free doctors, the thinking goes, are more likely to come from a higher income background ? and expect a higher salary. Those who accumulate debt to pursue a medical degree may have lower expectations ? or put less emphasis on ? their ultimate earnings.</p> <p>More recent research on medical student decision-making suggests even more nuance to how doctors select their ultimate career path. Yeshiva University?s Martha Grayson recently looked at students who entered medical school intending to pursue a career in primary care ? and how much debt they accrued. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04340.x/abstract"">Her research</a>, published in the journal <em>Medical Education</em>, did find a relationship between debt and career choice: Students with more debt were more likely to shift their career path away from primary care.</p> <p>?Compared with their peers who sustained PC [primary care] career goals, those who switched career goals anticipated more debt and attached greater value to income,? Grayson concludes. ?Moreover, the decision to switch was associated with a marked increase in income expectations of an average of US$75,153.? </p> <p>Her research suggests ? much as would be expected ? that money does indeed matter in career decision making. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242bab3a/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417611/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242bab3a/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417611/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242bab3a/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544417611/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242bab3a/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

So China is rethinking its strategy:</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_296w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/ezra-klein/Images/509815364.jpg?uuid=5ajFvHNhEeG3R-5kJlrmxg"" /> </p> </p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The result is a looming financial disaster, not only for manufacturers but for state-owned banks that financed factories with approximately $18 billion in low-rate loans and for municipal and provincial governments that provided loan guarantees and sold manufacturers valuable land at deeply discounted prices.</p> <p>China?s biggest solar panel makers are suffering losses of up to $1 for every $3 of sales this year, as panel prices have fallen by three-fourths since 2008. ?</p> <p>The outcome has left even the architects of China?s renewable energy strategy feeling frustrated and eager to see many businesses shut down, so the most efficient companies may be salvageable financially.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>To get a sense for the scale here, we can compare what China and the United States have done for solar in recent times. As part of the stimulus program, the U.S. Department of Energy has handed out roughly <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/story/2011-10-03/solar-power-funds/50646694/1"">$14 billion</a> in federal loan guarantees to domestic solar projects since 2009. Most of this money has gone into R&#38;D and advanced technologies?including, yes, $535 million for Solyndra. (There has also been a <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Pages/1603.aspx"">refundable tax credit</a> for anyone who generates electricity from solar power in the United States, but that benefits all companies equally.)</p> <p>By contrast, China?s state-owned banks alone have shelled out $18 billion in low-rate, preferential loans to solar companies over the past five years ? most of which have gone to basic factories and manufacturers. In addition, China?s local governments have provided a slew of loan guarantees and cheap land to solar producers. Bradsher reports that the total subsidies could come to $50 billion over the next 20 years for every 10 gigawatts of solar power installed. That?s an enormous difference.</p> <p>So it?s not surprising that China now dominates the solar market. The country has about two-thirds of the world?s solar manufacturing capacity and was churning out panels for less than $1 per watt at the end of 2011, about <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/chinas-growing-share-of-solar-market-comes-at-a-price/2011/11/21/gIQAhPRWyO_print.html"">20 percent cheaper</a> than anywhere else on Earth. That helps explain why, in the United States, the retail price of solar power has fallen by half and why rooftop installations doubled in 2011.</p> <p>But the party may end soon. Bradsher reports that China?s economic planners want to cut off loans for all but the strongest solar manufacturers and let the rest go bankrupt. Would that be a good thing? It depends. The price of Chinese solar panels would likely rise as a result. That would provide a boost to U.S. solar manufacturers who have been struggling against cheaper Chinese imports. (In May, the U.S. Commerce Department slapped a <a href=""http://ia.ita.doc.gov/download/factsheets/factsheet-prc-solar-cells-ad-prelim-20120517.pdf"" target=""_blank"">31 percent tariff</a> on imports of silicon photovoltaic cells from certain Chinese manufacturers, alleging that they were unfairly subsidized.)</p> <p>Over at Resources for the Future, Nathan Richardson <a href=""http://common-resources.org/2012/china-losing-money-on-solar-a-good-thing-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CommonResources+%28Common+Resources%29"">takes a different view</a>: ?[C]heap solar panels are fantastic in their own right,? he notes. ?It doesn?t really matter who makes them. If we can buy cheap panels from China, we can spend the resources we?d otherwise use on other things. ?  China?s solar policy may not be a good idea economically (for China). But they are doing their bit, perhaps unintentionally, to build the technology that can avert climate change.?</p> <p>In any case, not all analysts are convinced that the surge in U.S. solar installations would collapse if China were to consolidate its solar industry. Back in May, in a <a href=""http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/05/china_solar.html"">policy brief</a> for the Center for American Progress, Melanie Hart and Kate Gordon pointed out that the key drivers of America?s solar surge have been demand-side policies, such as tax credits for installation or state-level renewable energy standards, and not low Chinese prices. ?If you look within the U.S. market,? Hart and Gordon write, ?there is a huge amount of variation from state to state, and <a href=""http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/us--installations-rise-but-dominated-by-california_100004705/#axzz1u72G1gIW"">that variation</a> is primarily due to differences in state incentives.?</p> <p>So China?s frantic push to hand out cheap solar panels (and wind turbines) to the rest of the world could soon slow down. But that won?t necessarily mean the end of the world?s <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/06/19/are-we-wildly-underestimating-solar-and-wind-power/"">recent solar-power boom</a> ? that will depend on whether countries like the United States enact further policies to boost renewables or not.</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/06/19/are-we-wildly-underestimating-solar-and-wind-power/"">Are we wildly underestimating solar and wind power?</a> </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242baa3c/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417497/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242baa3c/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417497/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242baa3c/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544417497/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242baa3c/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Mitt Romney said during Wednesday?s debate, ?preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.?</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/255px-Romney_portrait.jpeg"" /> </p> </p> <p>Actually, they?re not. Romney?s campaign admitted as much later in the night. If you?ve been uninsured at any point in the past couple of years, you?re not protected under Romney?s plan. The Commonwealth Fund says that means <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/10/who-would-be-left-out-of-romneys-preexisting-conditions-plan-about-89-million-americans/"">89 million</a> Americans will be left out in the cold. As Paul Krugman <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/opinion/krugman-romneys-sick-joke.html?_r=1&#38;hp"">notes</a>, that?s a third of the non-elderly population.</p> <p>But there?s something else Romney said about health care at the debate that matters much more, but is getting much less attention.</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let?s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>A fair read of that statement would make you think Romney wants to make it possible for every state to follow Massachusetts?s example. But a fair read of his policies makes it clear that Romney wants to make it impossible for any state to follow Massachusetts?s example ? and perhaps impossible for Massachusetts to keep the very plan Romney passed going.</p> <p>The key question for any health-care plan is how are you going to pay for it? The Massachusetts plan used three funding sources.</p> <p>The first ? and, in some ways, the most important ? was a $385 million annual payment then-Sen. Ted Kennedy had negotiated for the state?s safety net hospitals. President George W. Bush wanted to end the payment. That set off a panic in Massachusetts, and led to Romney and Kennedy going to the Bush administration and making a deal: Massachusetts could keep the money if they put it towards a universal health-care plan. Oh, and they needed to come up with that plan soon.</p> <p>This was the threat that forced Romney and the state?s Democrats to pass a plan, as not passing a plan would mean losing billions in free federal money.</p> <p>The state also found two other funding sources. They covered absolutely everyone they could cover in their Medicaid program so they could get the most generous possible match from the federal government. Right now, Medicaid is helping Massachusetts cover kids and adults up to 300 percent of the poverty line ? an incredible deal.</p> <p>Finally, Massachusetts had imposed a tax to reimburse hospitals for the care they provided to the uninsured. Romney took the money from that tax and put it toward the law.</p> <p>That?s two pots of federal money and a tax. So how much of Romney?s proposal relied on these funds? ?100 percent,? says Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who helped Romney design the law. ?That was my whole job. Saying whether we could fit what he wanted to do within those three funding sources.?</p> <p>The legislature ended up adding a bit of general revenue to the law. But the fact remains: The Massachusetts law relies on federal dollars and state taxes.</p> <p>But Romney?s health-care proposal doesn?t make it easier for other states to follow the Massachusetts example. It makes it almost impossible. He?s not offering states access to federal funds for universal coverage. Here?s what he?s doing:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you?re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you?re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. </p> </blockquote> </p> <p>That sounds nice, but it?s a cut to Medicaid of <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/17/romneys-health-care-plans-dont-exempt-todays-seniors/?print=1"">more than $600 billion</a>. And that?s before we even get into Romney?s repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which pushes the Medicaid cuts well above $1 trillion. That means Medicaid won?t be able to offer such generous matches in the future. </p> <p>?He?s pulling up the ladder behind him,? Gruber says. ?There?s a legitimate issue of can Massachusetts even do it anymore? If they block grant us and don?t let the block grants grow, federal funds will become a smaller and smaller share. And we never would?ve done this at 100 percent state funding.?</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242b93c8/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544356491/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242b93c8/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544356491/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242b93c8/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544356491/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242b93c8/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Ezra has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/05/september-jobs-report-debunking-the-jobs-report-conspiracy-theories/"">dispatched</a> with those quite nicely. But it raises a broader question. How does the Bureau of Labor Statistics derive these numbers? How accurate is that process? And how susceptible is it to tampering?</p> <p>The jobs report actually compiles the results of two different surveys: the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is commonly dubbed the ?household survey,? and Current Economic Statistics (CES), or the ?employer survey.? The household survey produces the unemployment rate, and the employer survey produces the ?nonfarm payrolls? number, which is the most common measure of jobs gained.</p> <p> <strong>Household survey</strong> </p> <p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/faq.htm#Ques2"">CPS</a> is a monthly survey of households that asks which people in the household have worked (or were temporarily absent) in the past week; which have actively looked for work in the past month but did not work; and which neither looked for work nor worked. It?s jointly run by BLS and the Census Bureau and has been conducted since 1940.</p> <p>The number of people who either worked or looked for work is defined as the ?labor force?. The CPS calculates both the ?labor force participation rate? ? which is the fraction of people over 16 and not in prison who are in the labor force ? and the ?unemployment rate?, which is the percentage of the labor force not working.</p> <p>It also calculates a number of ?alternative? unemployment measures by asking if members of the household have concluded that no work is available (the ?U-4? measure), have given up looking for work but would still like a job (the ?U-5? measure), or are working part-time but would like to be working full-time (the ?U-6? measure). These tend to be higher than the regular unemployment rate. This month, U-6 was unchanged because a lot of the job gains came in part-time work, but all the others went down.</p> <p>BLS also asks if members of the household lost their jobs in the month in question, and if they?ve been unemployed more than 15 weeks. Both of these measures went down last month, which is another sign that the labor market is recovering.</p> <p>The CPS sample includes about <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/homch1_f.htm"">66,000 households</a>. Every month, 25 percent of the sample is changed, so that the sample is not just studying the same group of people. The response rate is very high ? usually <a href=""http://www.census.gov/cps/methodology/nonresponse.html"">more than 90 percent</a>. By contrast, opinion polls have a response rate of around <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/poll-response-rates_n_1518501.html"">9 percent</a>, and contain samples a fraction of that size.</p> <p>But even still, there is a lot of room for error. The BLS <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf"" target=""_blank"">estimates</a> that the standard error for the unemployment rate is 0.1 points. That means that the margin of error, like that you?d use for polls, is about 0.196 points:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/unemployment_error.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/unemployment_error.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>It?s higher for <em>changes</em> in the unemployment rate ? the standard error is 0.12, so the margin of error is around 0.2352. But the drop in unemployment last month was 0.3 points ? so outside the margin of error, and statistically significant. As former Labor Department economist Betsy Stevenson explains, that?s a <a href=""http://twitter.com/BetseyStevenson/status/254238435022344192"">clear improvement</a>.</p> <p> <strong>Employer survey</strong> </p> <p>What about the CES? That <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesfaq.htm#scope1"">surveys</a> 141,000 employers, both private and public, at 486,000 worksites and asks for the number of employees, hours worked, and earnings. ?Employees? includes both part-time and full-time labor, and is a snapshot taken at the twelfth of the month. ?Employment is the total number of persons on establishment payrolls employed full-or part-time who received pay for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th day of the month,? BLS explains. It excludes the self-employed, volunteers, farm workers, and domestic workers. But it includes workers who are on strike, and those working for two different businesses are double-counted.</p> <p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesvarae.htm#t2fa1"">standard error</a> for CES is enormous - 55,254 for monthly change. That means the margin of error (at a 95 percent confidence level) is 108,293 ? nearly the total number of jobs gained last month. So this month?s job gain was statistically different from zero, but many past ones were not:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/payrolls_error.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/payrolls_error.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>What?s this about the seasons?</strong> </p> <p>Both the CPS and the CES use a process called ?seasonal adjustment.? They figure that employment usually follows certain seasonal patterns. Construction workers don?t work in the winter, high school and college graduates get hired in the spring, teachers get laid off for the summer, etc. They then adjust the number of employed and unemployed people by what you?d expect to change due to seasonal factors.</p> <p>As Brad has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/05/wait-the-u-s-economy-actually-lost-1-2-million-jobs-in-july/"">noted</a>, there?s some evidence that the adjustment formula has gone awry, as there is a wide divergence in the summer and winter jobs numbers, with the latter usually stronger, as you can see in the above figure.</p> <p> <strong>How secure is it?</strong> </p> <p>As my colleague Eli Saslow <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jobs-day-an-economic-and-political-obsession/2012/03/09/gIQADZPW1R_story.html"">notes</a>, the BLS process is highly confidential. Economists are put on an eight-day security lockdown in advance of the report, signing confidentiality agreements every morning. The computers they use feature heavy encryption, and data is placed in a safe even for bathroom breaks. The Wednesday before the release, the CPS data comes in, followed by the CES data a few days after.</p> <p>On the day before the release, three copies of the report and a CD-ROM are placed in a safe and taken to downtown Washington from the secure location where they were prepared, and presented to the few White House officials who have permission for a sneak peek at the numbers. Journalists are given access to the information 30 minutes before release but have to connect to a secure network that prevents them from sending out the data ahead of its official release.</p> <p> <strong>As nonpartisan as government gets</strong> </p> <p>The BLS is a highly nonpartisan operation, existing since 1884 and <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/senior_staff/galvin.htm"">headed</a> by Jack Galvin, a career employee who ran the employment and unemployment statistics division from 1998 to 2011, and has held a variety of positions there since 1978. Prior to him, Keith Hall headed the agency from 2008 to 2012, following career positions at the Council of Economic Advisors and the International Trade Commission. It?s normal for BLS commissioners to <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/home.htm"">span administrations and parties</a>. Janet Norwood headed the agency from 1979 to 1991, spanning Carter, Reagan, and Bush I, while her predecessor Julius Shiskin headed it under Nixon, Ford and Carter.</p> <p>Hall has <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/10/05/impossible-to-manipulate-labor-survey-data-former-bls-head/"">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>that it is ?impossible? to alter the numbers for political gain. But that hasn?t stopped some from harboring conspiracy theories about their political manipulation. Former GE chief Jack Welch today <a href=""http://twitter.com/jack_welch/status/254198154260525057"">tweeted</a> that ?these Chicago guys will do anything?can?t debate so change numbers,? implying the Obama administration artificially inflated the figures.</p> <p>But presidents themselves have worried about the agency in the past. Richard Nixon infamously <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/whats_the_matter_with_virginia_part_2.html"">asked</a> his aide Fred Malek to count the number of Jews working in BLS, based on his delusion that Jewish liberals were trying to sabotage him through bad jobs numbers.  Suffice it to say, none of these conspiracy theories ? be they anti-semitic or anti-Obama ? have any truth to them.</p> <p> <em>The original version of the post confused benchmark revisions to the CES with ones to the CPS.

Now here are a few other tidbits in the report that you might have missed:</p> <p> <strong> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/OB-UW029_obajob_E_20121005104021.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/OB-UW029_obajob_E_20121005104021.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>1) Obama?s track record on jobs.</strong> Over at the Wall Street Journal, Sudeep Reddy <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/10/05/jobs-under-obama/"">explains</a> that since President Obama took office in January 2009, private non-farm payrolls have risen by 514,000 and government payrolls have dropped by 575,000.</p> <p>Now, if you add in the Bureau of Labor Statistics? <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">preliminary benchmark revisions</a> (which offer an even more accurate look at jobs figures), then the private sector has created 967,000 jobs since Obama took office, while governments at all levels have shed 642,000 jobs.</p> <p> <strong>2) Why last month?s drop in unemployment is unlikely to be a total fluke.</strong> The unemployment rate is calculated from a monthly survey of 60,000 households. As such, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-drops-the-neutron-bomb-on-people-who-think-the-unemployment-rate-was-cooked-2012-10"">it?s likely to be a bit volatile</a>. This month, the household survey showed that 873,000 more Americans were employed in September than in July, with unemployment dropping 0.3 points to 7.8 percent. That could be wrong. But labor economist Betsey Stevenson argues on Twitter that the drop in unemployment is statistically significant. ?A fall of 0.3 may be bigger or smaller than 0.3,? she <a href=""https://twitter.com/BetseyStevenson/status/254238435022344192"">notes</a>, ?but it is a clear fall.? </p> <p>So, although the unemployment rate could tick back up a bit next month, as the household survey data bounces around, the improvement in the labor market in September is very likely to be real. </p> <p> <strong>3) There?s some evidence that business creation is picking up in the United States. </strong>Here?s one theory for why the Bureau of Labor Statistics?s household survey (which showed a big drop in the unemployment rate) looks stronger than the agency?s payroll survey (which showed that the economy only added 114,000 jobs in September). It could be that the payroll survey, which tends to survey established companies and government, is missing an uptick in new business creation.</p> <p>As <a href=""https://twitter.com/jdlahart/status/254218195706195968"">Justin Lahart</a> and economist <a href=""https://twitter.com/justinwolfers/status/254220386181476352"">Justin Wolfers</a> point out, if business creation <em>were</em> picking up, then you?d expect to see a stronger household survey and a big upward revision when the BLS goes through its payroll data more carefully each year. And that?s exactly what happened?by poring through state-level tax data, BLS <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">found an extra 386,000 jobs in March of 2012</a> than it had originally estimated. And the household data is way up. Still, this is just a theory.</p> <p> <strong>4) Manufacturing is weakening, while other sectors are up.</strong> <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/10/americas-jobs-report?fsrc=gn_ep"">Here?s</a> Greg Ip: ?[T]he gains were concentrated in health care, transportation and warehousing, and finance. Manufacturing employment dropped, which corroborates weakness in factory activity that may reflect the slowing global economy and worries about a recession if politicians don?t move the year-end ?fiscal cliff.??</p> <p> <strong>5) Political scientists say this unemployment report probably won?t influence the presidential election.</strong> <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/09/11/how-the-economy-matters-from-here-to-november/"">Here?s a line</a> from Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien, who reviewed 60 years of economic and elections data: ?[O]ne can predict the actual vote from the current income growth about as well in April as in November. By April, the economic cake is largely baked.? John Sides <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/05/todays-jobs-report-will-it-matter-on-election-day/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themonkeycagefeed+%28The+Monkey+Cage%29"">concurs</a> that ?late changes in the economy aren?t that consequential,? although he adds that a strong jobs report might blunt some of Mitt Romney?s recent momentum in the polls.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242a8fbb/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544410538/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a8fbb/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544410538/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a8fbb/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544410538/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a8fbb/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

State governments added 13,000 jobs in September, marking their third straight month of public gains. It?s been a slow recovery for state employees, but the numbers have generally been creeping upwards since December 2011, when state government employment was at its lowest level since the beginning of the recession.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/MN-300x197.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>The gains were concentrated in education, which one would expect employment to increase as we head towards the beginning of the school year. But the numbers are seasonally adjusted, meaning they take that annual bump into account. </p> <p>The improved hiring makes sense as state budgets are finally starting to <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/press-room/state-budget-update-spring-2012.aspx"">recover</a> from the lost revenue and austerity measures they imposed during the recession, particularly after the stimulus money expired. State <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/projected-tax-growth-in-fy-2013.aspx"">tax revenues</a> are finally started to come back as business and personal incomes have recovered: State tax collections have risen for the past 10 consecutive quarters, and they?re projected to keep rising in 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.  About a third of states also rely on a real-estate transfer tax that?s also recovering more money as the housing market has started to come back.</p> <p>But overall, public-sector jobs still have a long way to come back, given the severity of government budget cutbacks that have been made. Overall, about 600,000 government jobs have been <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/public-sector-austerity-in-one-graph/2012/06/11/gJQAv89NVV_blog.html"">lost</a> since the beginning of the recession. Local government jobs have recovered somewhat since June ? when the sector hit its lowest level of employment since the beginning of the recession ? but they shed 7,000 jobs between August and September. What?s more, the looming sequester could mean cutbacks in 2013 ? not just on the federal level but on the <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-03/u-dot-s-dot-states-teetering-on-brink-of-fiscal-cliff-ganeriwala-says"">state</a> and local level as well, as the nation?s mayors have warned.</p> <p>*Update: Here?s even more on government job growth from Brookings? Gary Burtless: ?This is the first time since March?May 2010, when the Census Bureau was adding temporary workers for the decennial census, that we have had three successive months in which government employment increased?The latest BLS statistics show that government employment is now adding to rather than subtracting from employment growth.?</p> <p>JPMorgan?s chief economist Michael Feroli delves into the same trend. ? Government employment increased 10,000 last month, and even more surprising, was revised up significantly over the past two months,? he writes. ?The big upward revision came from 91,000 extra government jobs, mostly local education.?</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242a2e7a/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544347111/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a2e7a/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544347111/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a2e7a/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544347111/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a2e7a/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

How high? Well, Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney at the Hamilton Project, who have done the best work on this, have <a href=""http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/Regardless_of_the_Cost_College_Still_Matters/"">calculated</a> the costs and benefits of going to college from the 1970s to the present. They find that the benefits have gone up steadily each year, while the costs have, contrary to popular belief, not risen quite as fast: </p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/monetarylifetime.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>This means that the annual return on investment has stayed relatively constant for the past 35-odd years at around 17 percent, far more than any conventional investment:</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/ROI.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>Most strikingly of all, the above graphs don?t include financial aid, which has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/14/colleges-payoff-is-declining-unless-you-have-financial-aid/"">skyrocketed</a> over the past few decades. That suggests that the return on investment has actually gone up.</p> <p>Today?s <a href=""http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"" target=""_blank"">jobs report</a> drives the point home. The unemployment rate among those with a bachelor?s degree or higher is 4.1 percent. The rate for high school graduates is 8.7 percent, and for dropouts it?s a staggering 11.3 percent (though this group saw most of the gains this past month). Assuming the returns stay as high as Greenstone and Looney calculate, getting more people into college could push the overall unemployment rate down considerably.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/2429e310/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544344224/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/2429e310/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544344224/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/2429e310/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544344224/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/2429e310/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Case in point, within minutes of the jobs report, Twitter filled with Republicans <a href=""https://twitter.com/jack_welch/status/254198154260525057"">claiming</a> the books were somehow cooked, the numbers aren?t real, etc.</p> <p>Let?s take a deep breath. Jobs reports are about the economy, not about the election. Confusing the two leads to very bad analysis.</p> <p>This is a good jobs report in a still-weak economy. The 114,000 jobs we added in September aren?t very impressive. The revisions to the last two months, which added 86,000 jobs to the total, were much more impressive. Those revisions also suggest that September?s jobs could get revised up ? or, of course, down. So be careful about reading too much into that number. Still, these are, at best, good, not great, numbers.</p> <p>The controversy, if it?s worth using that word, is over the unemployment rate, which dropped from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent. That?s three-tenths of one percent. That?s what all the fuss is about.</p> <p>Let?s get one thing out of the way: The data was not, as Jack Welch suggested in a now-infamous tweet, manipulated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jobs-day-an-economic-and-political-obsession/2012/03/09/gIQADZPW1R_story.html%20"">set up to ensure the White House has no ability to influence it</a>. As labor economist Betsey Stevenson <a href=""https://twitter.com/betseystevenson/status/254207418182008832"">wrote</a>, ?anyone who thinks that political folks can manipulate the unemployment data are completely ignorant of how the BLS works and how the data are compiled.? Plus, if the White House somehow was manipulating the data, don?t you think they would have made the payroll number look a bit better than 114,000? No one would have batted an eye at 160,000.</p> <p>The fact is that there?s not much that needs to be explained here. We?ve seen drops like this ? and even drops bigger than this ? before. Between July and August the unemployment rate dropped from 8.3 percent to 8.1 percent ? two-tenths of one percent. November-December of 2011 also saw a .2 percent drop. November-December of 2010 saw a .4 percent drop. This isn?t some incredible aberration. The fact that the unemployment rate broke under the psychologically important 8 percent line is making this number feel bigger to people than it really is.</p> <p>The number could, of course, be wrong. The household survey is, well, a survey, which means it?s open to error. But the internals back it up. The number saying they had jobs increased by about 800,000. That seems high, but it?s counting 582,000 who say they got part-time jobs.</p> <p>There?s precedent for this. As Daniel Indiviglio <a href=""https://twitter.com/indiviglio/status/254210775898529792"">notes</a>, part-time jobs increased by 579,000 in September 2010 and by 483,000 in September 2011. It might simply be seasonal hiring. You don?t need to resort to <a href=""https://twitter.com/conncarroll/status/254203443642781697"">ridiculous theories</a> like Democrats across the country suddenly deciding to lie to surveytakers in order to help Obama.</p> <p>Which leads to another argument: That U6, the broadest measure of labor-market pain, didn?t move, which should make us skeptical of the fact that U3, the normal unemployment rate, did move. That?s just misunderstanding what U6 is.</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>U6 is not an unemployment measure. It includes part-time workers who want full-time work. So it doesn?t count the increase in part-time work. But every measure of actual unemployment ? U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5 ? went down. You can see them all <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm"">here</a>. Again, there?s no mystery.</p> <p>This is an encouraging report. What it tells us is that the labor market has been a bit better over the last few months than we thought, and that the recovery hasn?t slowed in the ways we feared. What the response to it tells us is that the election is driving people a little bit crazy. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24296dd8/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544401260/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24296dd8/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544401260/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24296dd8/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544401260/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24296dd8/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

That?s now the lowest level since January 2009. And, for once, the rate fell because Americans are actually finding work?and not just dropping out of the labor force. That?s genuinely good news for an economy that?s still struggling.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/04/19/National-Economy/Images/carpenter.JPG"" /> </p> </p> <p>There are two different numbers used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure the health of the labor market. There?s the payroll survey, which collects data from businesses and government. The headline number here is quite modest, suggesting that the U.S. economy added just 114,000 jobs in September.</p> <p>The truly upbeat part came in the data revisions. As it turns out, those lackluster months of July and August were better than we thought. The agency now says that the U.S. economy added 181,000 jobs in July, rather than 141,000. And it says that the economy added 142,000 jobs in August, rather than a mere 96,000. To be clear, this is still a middling recovery. At this pace, it will take <a href=""http://www.hamiltonproject.org/jobs_gap/"">more than a decade</a> to return to full employment. But at least the economy wasn?t slowing down dramatically over the summer, as originally reported.</p> <p>BLS also publishes the household survey, which <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces_cps_trends.pdf#page=2"" target=""_blank"">asks individuals</a> about their work situation. This is used to calculate the official unemployment rate. And the household numbers were exceptionally strong this month, showing 873,000 more employed Americans in September than in July. That?s a massive boost, and explains why the unemployment rate plunged to 7.8 percent.</p> <p>The employment-to-population ratio also increased by 0.4 percentage points to 58.7 percent. That, too, is an encouraging sign. In the past, the unemployment rate had fallen mainly because more Americans were giving up on searching for work <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-incredible-shrinking-labor-force/2012/05/04/gIQANXAy1T_blog.html"">and dropping out of the labor force</a>. Not this time. The modest improvement appears to be real.</p> <p>So what explains this surge in employment? It?s possible that the jump in this month?s household survey was merely a fluke?the household survey <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces_cps_trends.pdf#page=2"" target=""_blank"">is generally noisier and more volatile</a> than the payroll data. Another possibility is that the increase was driven by a rise in part-time workers, as there are 582,000 more people working part-time this month than last.</p> <p>But before anyone gets ecstatic at the jobs situation, let?s add a few sobering notes of caution. There are still 12.1 million unemployed people in the United States and an additional 2.5 million people who would like jobs but are too discouraged to look. Within that group, there are still 4.8 million people who have been jobless for at least 27 weeks. The labor market is still very, very far from healthy.</p> <p>And, of course, the biggest caveat of all is that these jobs numbers could well be wrong. The monthly payroll numbers tend to get revised in subsequent months as BLS collects fuller data. The July and August jobs reports just got revamped upward by a combined 86,000 jobs. And, in its annual benchmark revision, BLS found that it had essentially been under-counting the number of new jobs <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">by about 30,000 per month</a> between April 2011 and May 2012. This isn?t a conspiracy on the part of government statisticians, as former GE CEO Jack Welch <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-05/former-ge-ceo-jack-welch-says-white-house-manipulates-jobs-data.html"">suggested</a> today. Getting the numbers right is inherently difficult.</p> <p>So this month?s jobs report is encouraging, but we should all be wary of reading too much into any one month?s report.</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> </p> <p>? <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/05/the-jobs-report-in-six-charts/"">The jobs report in six charts</a> </p> <p>? The economy added <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">386,000 more jobs last year</a> than we thought.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242919fd/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544336110/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242919fd/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544336110/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242919fd/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544336110/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242919fd/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Unemployment fell 0.3 points to 7.8 percent, and the economy gained 114,000 jobs in September ? and revisions added another 86,000 jobs to the July and August numbers.</p> <p>How does that compare to past months? Let?s find out:</p> <p> <strong>Unemployment and Payroll Numbers</strong> </p> <p>Unemployment took the biggest fall in months, reaching below 8 percent for the first time since January 2009:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_unemployment-payrolls.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_unemployment-payrolls.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p></p> <p> <strong>Labor force participation</strong> </p> <p>That said, the unemployment rate is a function of two things: the number of people employed, and the number of people in the labor force. But the proportion of people in the labor force actually went up, suggesting the fall in the unemployment rate reflects a real improvement, rather than people stopping their work search:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_labor_force.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_labor_force.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>Public and private</strong> </p> <p>Public employment stopped falling for the first time since February. Whereas previous July and August numbers saw it falling, revised numbers suggest that 73,000 public jobs were added in the past three months:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_public_private.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_public_private.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>Alternative Unemployment Measures</strong> </p> <p>As I explained <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/03/the-jobs-report-in-six-nay-seven-charts/http:/www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/the-jobs-report-in-five-charts-2/"">last month</a>, the BLS releases six unemployment measures. There?s U3, the number that shows up in all the news article, which counts people who don?t have jobs, but have looked for one in the past four weeks, but U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 exist as well.  U1 and U2 are usually lower than U3, and measure the percentage of people who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer and the percentage who have lost jobs or done temporary work in the period in question, respectively.</p> <p>U4, U5 and U6 are usually higher than U3. Each of these categories includes everyone in all the lower categories: all people in U3 are in U4, all people in U4 are in U5, and all people in U5 are in U6. U4 adds people who have stopped looking for work because they?ve concluded none is available. U5 adds people who would like to work but for whatever reason have not looked for work recently. U6 adds the underemployed, or part-time workers who want to be working full-time but cannot for whatever reason.</p> <p>The six measures are pretty well coordinated, and all but U6 ticked down in September, suggesting again that the drop reflects real improvement:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>Sectors</strong> <br /> </p> <p>Different sectors were hit to varying degrees by the downturn.

At 8:30 a.m., we?ll get the first read on how many jobs the economy created in September. According to the 88 economists <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-05/jobless-rate-probably-climbed-as-u-s-employers-limited-hiring.html"">surveyed</a> by Bloomberg News, the consensus expectation is that we?ll get at about 115,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate might inch up a bit. </p> <p>It?s worth emphasizing that today?s jobs number, whether it?s high or low, is also going to be dead wrong. We?ve been learning the hard way lately that these initial numbers are subject to quite a bit of error. Last week, for instance, we got new data showing the economy had created 386,000 more jobs than we thought between April 2011 and March 2012. That said, the likelihood that a political media hungry for new narratives to impose on the election will stay its hand out of fear of future data revisions is, well, not good.</p> <p> <strong> <em>Top story: Moderate Mitt?</em> </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Meet ?Moderate Mitt,? the man who emerged from Wednesday night?s debate.</strong> ?He used the first presidential debate to speak out forcefully to its wide television audience against the idea of cutting taxes for the wealthy, noting that ?high-income people are doing just fine in this economy.? Asked if there was too much government regulation, he answered, ?regulation is essential.? And he praised the Massachusetts health care bill, calling it a ?model for the nation.? These are all things that President Obama says occasionally on the campaign trail. But in this case, the lines were uttered at the debate Wednesday night in Denver by his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. Mr. Romney ran to the right in the Republican primaries in 2008 and this year, describing himself this winter as having been a ?severely conservative? governor. This week, he pivoted to the center, as many political analysts had long expected him to do, seeking to appeal to more centrist general election voters. In doing so, Mr. Romney used striking new language to describe his policy proposals on taxes, education and health care in ways that may assuage independent voters ? but which may be sowing confusion about how Mr. Romney would govern.? <em>Michael Cooper, David Kocieniewski, and Jackie Calmes in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/us/politics/entering-stage-right-romney-moved-to-center.html?partner=rss&#38;emc=rss"" target=""_blank"">Politico</a>.</em> </p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/05/wonkbook-the-return-of-moderate-mitt/us-vote-2012-republican-campaign-romney/""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/wonk1005.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/253974310006431744"" target=""_blank"">@sahilkapur</a>: Looks like conservatives have set Romney free.

A good chunk of Iran?s $110 billion foreign exchange reserves <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/world/middleeast/irans-rial-plummets-against-the-dollar.html?hp"">is locked up</a> in offshore accounts that are now frozen. Overseas banks have been barred from doing business with Iran?s central bank. And Iran is having trouble selling its oil abroad. Add it all up, and those sanctions have restricted the supply of dollars and other foreign currency reaching Iran.</p> <p>This has made it extremely difficult for Iran?s central bank to maintain its currency peg of 12,260 rials to the dollar. Individuals and businesses are instead buying up scarce dollars and euros on the black market, often to pay for imports. As more Iranians try to trade their rials for (increasingly rare) foreign currency, dollars get pricier and the value of the rial drops.</p> <p>That problem finally exploded last month. In the black markets, the value of Iran?s rial has now plunged 65 percent in the past few weeks.

The country?s monthly inflation rate, Hanke estimates, is now 69.6 percent. That?s hyperinflation territory.</p> <p>What triggered last month?s sudden collapse? That?s not yet clear. One <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/world/middleeast/irans-rial-plummets-against-the-dollar.html?hp"">explanation</a> is that the Iranian government set up official ?currency centers? to sell dollars at a discount to businesses that import, say, meat or grain or medicine. The idea was to ration out foreign currency to those who need it most. But the move may have stoked widespread panic that the government was running out of dollars, triggering a run on the rial.</p> <p>Iran?s hyperinflation isn?t yet on par with the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/21/great-hyperinflation-episodes-in-history-and-what-they-tell-us-about-the-fed/"">most out-of-control episodes in history</a>?such as Hungary in 1945 or Zimbabwe in 2007. But it?s a reminder that hyperinflation is usually a problem that plagues countries hit by a severe external shock, rather than a result of, say, quantitative easing.</p> <p>The Christian Science Monitor <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/1004/Iran-s-currency-Why-did-the-rial-tumble-so-precipitously/(page)/2"">has more</a> on how Iran found itself in this situation, noting that the country?s atrophied private sector and the government?s failure to build up sufficient foreign reserves has made the country extremely vulnerable to currency speculation. Over at FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska <a href=""http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/10/03/1190441/greshams-law-takes-iran/"">also delves</a> into Iran?s woes, noting: ?At this point, Iran is running out of options.

Gerald Ford saying, ?There is no Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe.? Ronald Reagan saying, ?There you go again.? Al Gore sighing. And sighing. And sighing.</p> <p>Those moments matter because they become the shorthand for the media?s subsequent discussion of the debate. But it was hard for me to think of any definitional moments, for either candidate, in last night?s debate. Almost everyone ? myself included ? thought Obama came off listless and unprepared. He clearly lost the night. But he didn?t make any big mistakes. Romney, by contrast, was aggressive and quick on his feet. But, more so than Obama, he might come to regret a few of the things he said. </p> <p>There was a point in the debate, for instance, when Romney repeatedly insisted his Medicare reforms wouldn?t touch current seniors. ?If you?re 60 or around 60 or older, you don?t need to listen any further,? he said with a smile. ?Again,? he said a moment later, ?that?s for future people, right, not for current retirees.?</p> <p>This is standard Republican fare, but it comes off rather badly, I think. When you keep saying that you wouldn?t dare impose your plan on current retirees, it doesn?t exactly signal that this is the kind of plan that people are actually going to like. </p> <p>There was also an exchange over the tax break for moving companies overseas. Romney denied its existence. ?Look, I?ve been in business for 25 years,? he said. ?I have no idea what you?re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.?</p> <p>If Obama had been a better debater, the ?I maybe need to get a new accountant? line, given Romney?s unusually low tax rate, could have been devastating. As it is, I?d expect to see it in ads soon. And, for the record, that tax break really does exist, though it?s not specifically for firms that move overseas. As Reuters <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/04/us-usa-campaign-check-idUSBRE89307P20121004"">explains</a>, ?What Obama was actually describing was a tax break for ordinary business expense, including deductions allowed for a company if it closes its plant in the United States and moves it to another country.?</p> <p>But insofar as the debate had any defining exchanges, it was the 40-minute back-and-forth in which Obama accused Romney of proposing a $5 trillion tax cut, Romney forswore any such plan, Obama insisted Romney did have that plan, Romney replied he would never even consider such a thing, etc and so on. The truth is that Romney has proposed a tax cut that would cost $5 trillion, but he?s promised to figure out how to pay for it at some later date. Whether you think Romney should get credit for that promise is up to you. But the Obama campaign clearly thinks that that moment represents a vulnerability for Romney:</p> <p></p> <p>Ouch.</p> <p>Conversely, Romney?s Web site doesn?t have any new ads up using debate clips, which confirms my sense that while Obama didn?t acquit himself particularly well, he didn?t say anything the Romney campaign sees much upside in jumping on.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign is nevertheless feeling very good today, as they should. Almost 60 million people <a href=""http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/debate-ratings-fox-news-tops-cable-news-for-first-debate-as-more-people-tune-in-than-2008_b148739#more-148739"">watched</a> last night?s debate. That means Romney?s best night of the campaign happened before the single largest audience of the campaign. No ad the Obama team can release will be nearly as widely viewed. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242220c6/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544340834/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242220c6/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544340834/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242220c6/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544340834/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242220c6/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

So here are some of the more thoughtful estimates from the election wonks.</p> <p> <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/04/how-much-will-the-debate-shift-the-polls-heres-one-calculation/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themonkeycagefeed+%28The+Monkey+Cage%29"">John Sides</a>: ?Let?s assume that the same fraction of undecided voters shift in Romney?s direction as shifted in Bush?s direction.  In 2000, that was 25 percent of undecideds (3/12=.25).  In 2012, the proportion of undecideds is about 5 percent.  So 25 percent of 5 percent is 1.25 points?about what I predicted last night.  It could end up being a bit more, if you think that Obama has been out-performing the fundamentals of the race, and thus we were due for a course correction.?</p> <p> <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/polls-show-a-strong-debate-for-romney/"">Nate Silver</a>: ?It seems likely that Mr. Romney will make at least some gains in head-to-head polls after the debate, and entirely plausible that they will be toward the high end of the historical range, in which polls moved by about three percentage points toward the candidate who was thought to have the stronger debate.?</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108124/did-romney-reshape-the-race"">Nate Cohn</a>: ?Regardless of whether Romney has upended the race, he can expect something of a bounce in the post-debate polls. Following the first debate in 2004, Kerry closed to within 1.6 points in the RCP average, compared to his final 2.4-point defeat. Four years earlier still, Bush seized the lead in post-debate polls and didn?t relinquish it until the Election Day results showed Gore winning the popular vote?the key questions are whether Obama falls far beneath 49 percent and whether Romney can get past 47. If neither of these conditions are met, then Romney?s performance just wasn?t good enough.?</p> <p>It?s also worth remembering what political scientists Robert Erikson and Chistopher Wlezien <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Timeline-Presidential-Elections-Campaigns/dp/0226922154/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1349323515&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=the+timeline+of+presidential+elections"">found</a> after reviewing every public poll taken before and after every televised debate: ?the best prediction from the debates is the initial verdict before the debates.?</p> <p>Overall, I?d expect the polls to tighten, perhaps even substantially. But how much they tighten will be very telling. Wednesday was as good a night as Romney can expect to have in the rest of this campaign, in front of as big an audience as he?ll get, with a maximum of media coverage. So his bounce will help tell us how many voters really remain persuadable, or at least how many of the persuadable voters are paying attention to the final events of the campaign. If that number is high, Romney should close the gap substantially, if not pull slightly ahead. If it?s low, he won?t see much bounce, and it will be that much harder to see his path to victory. </p> <p>Think about the people you know: How many of the Obama voters who thought Romney won the debate seem ready to change their vote today? Personally, I don?t know any Obama voters who thought he won the debate. But I also don?t know any Obama voters who have said they?re now supporting Romney. Now, my circles are unusually politically active, and so their preferences are unusually hard to move. But remember that the most persuadable voters pay the least attention to politics, so they may not know or care that Obama lost a debate. The polls, in other words, will quickly tell us whether Obama simply looked bad or whether he lost real support.</p> <p>The second question, of course, will be whether the bounce persists. This is the first of three presidential debates. It?s possible all of them will be lopsided victories for Romney, but unlikely. The expectations game now is such that Obama won?t have to do that much better, and Romney won?t have to do that much worse, for Obama?s next performance to be graded more favorably. That?s basically what happened with the Bush-Kerry debates in 2004, and it helped Bush recover after his weak initial performance. So just as with the conventions, keep in mind that it will be very hard to say what effect ?the debates? had until they?re actually over.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242166bf/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275564/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166bf/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275564/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166bf/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544275564/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166bf/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

It also suggests that you should expect the Fed to declare at its next meeting a level of unemployment we?d need to reach for them to start tightening again. Here are some highlights.</p> <p> <strong>There was broad consensus on buying more assets</strong> </p> <p>Most committee members believed that buying new assets could ?provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.? And most also thought that buying mortgage-backed securities would be better than Treasuries. ?Some participants suggested that, all else being equal, MBS purchases could be preferable because they would more directly support the housing sector?One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors.?</p> <p>There were a few doubters, who ?expressed skepticism that additional policy accommodation could help spur an economy that they saw as held back by uncertainties and a range of structural issues.? Another worried that more asset buys ?could lead to excessive risk-taking on the part of some investors and so undermine financial stability over time.? But most participants noted that the Fed can always change the amount of assets they?re buying, and so negate these costs.</p> <p> <strong>But participants disagreed on tying policy to unemployment</strong> </p> <p>Some, like Columbia?s <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/15/michael-woodford-i-personally-would-have-gone-further-but-what-the-fed-did-is-definitely-a-step-in-the-right-direction/"">Michael Woodford</a>, have criticized the Fed for not tying policy to an explicit measure of economic health, such as the level of nominal GDP or the unemployment rate. The minutes suggest these critics have allies within the Fed: ?Many participants thought that more-effective forward guidance could be provided by specifying numerical thresholds for labor market and inflation indicators that would be consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels.?</p> <p>They argued this would provide greater clarity about the Fed?s future actions. These members <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/20/low-rates-until-unemployment-hits-5-5-a-fed-official-gives-his-plan-for-liftoff/"">likely included</a> Chicago Fed president Charles Evans, who has argued that the Fed should keep rates low until unemployment is below 7 percent or inflation is above 3, and Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota, who has proposed targets of 5.5 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively.</p> <p>But the members couldn?t agree on what those targets should be, and ?some were reluctant to specify explicit numerical thresholds out of concern that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process.? They concluded by agreeing that thresholds were useful, but that ?further work would be needed? to flesh out exactly which to use. So look out for a rule like Evans? or Kocherlakota?s at the next Fed meeting.</p> <p> <strong>They disagree about uncertainty</strong> </p> <p>Just like <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/08/how-do-we-know-if-we-have-a-policy-uncertainty-problem/"">economists outside the bank</a>, FOMC members disagreed about whether uncertainty regarding government policies, Europe, and other factors is slowing down the economy. ?Many participants?noted that a high level of uncertainty regarding the European fiscal and banking crisis and the outlook for U.S. fiscal and regulatory policies was weighing on confidence, thereby restraining household and business spending. however, others questioned the role of uncertainty as a factor constraining aggregate demand.?</p> <p> <strong>They disagree about what?s keeping unemployment high</strong> </p> <p>While the best economic evidence <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/06/bill-clinton-says-the-unemployed-dont-have-the-right-skills-its-not-so/"">suggests</a> that unemployment is high because people aren?t spending money, not because workers don?t have the right skills, many on the FOMC seem to disagree:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>?A few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within sectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available. It was also suggested that there was an ongoing process of polarization in the labor market, with the share of job opportunities in middle-skill occupations continuing to decline while the shares of low and high skill occupations increased. Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.?</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>There is <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/04/why-so-many-jobless-recoveries-its-the-robots/"">some evidence</a> for the polarization hypothesis, but the rest seems just wrong. Other discussion participants disputed the structural account, and noted that worse structural problems could arise if people remain unemployed and can?t keep up with employed workers in terms of skills:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>Several participants, while acknowledging some evidence of structural changes in the labor market, stated again that weak aggregate demand was the principal reason for the high unemployment rate. They saw slack in resource utilization as remaining wide, indicating an important role for additional policy accommodation. Several participants noted the risk that continued high levels of unemployment, even if initially cyclical, might ultimately induce adverse strucutral changes.</p> <p> In particular, they expressed concerns about the risk that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment and the depressed level of labor participation could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and prospects of those without jobs, thereby reducing the longer-run normal level of employment and potential output.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Translation: if we don?t fix unemployment now, we?re going to have fewer jobs and weaker growth for decades to come.</p> <p> <strong>Most people weren?t worried about inflation</strong> </p> <p>Participants largely agreed that inflation wouldn?t go above the 2 percent target the Fed has set: ?With longer-term inflation expectations stable and the unemployment rate elevated, participants generally anticipated that inflation over the medium run would likely run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate.?</p> <p>But a few participants worried that extended loose policy from the Fed could change that: ?A few participants felt that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over an extended period?posed upside risks to inflation. Other participants, by contrast, saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, given their expectations for sizable and persistent resource slack.?</p> <p> <strong>Everyone?s worried about the fiscal cliff</strong> </p> <p>FOMC members generally agreed that if we go over the ?fiscal cliff? come year?s end, with big tax increases and budget cuts set to take effect, the results would be harmful to the economy: ?Participants generally expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic activity over coming quarters?Participants?noted that if an agreement was not reached to tackle the existing tax cuts and scheduled spending reductions, a sharp consolidation of fiscal policy would take place at the beginning of 2013.? </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242166be/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275563/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166be/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275563/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166be/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544275563/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166be/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Here?s why he?s wrong.","3","-1","0","","2012-10-04 16:41:30","<p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_404h/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/on-small-business/Images/gina%20porto%20carnivore.JPG"" /> </p> </p> <p>In the tax portion of last night?s debate, Mitt Romney repeatedly claimed that President Obama will raise taxes on small businesses. ?Fifty-four percent of America?s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate,? he <a href=""http://apps.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcripts/2012/presidential/live/739/?hpid=z2"">argued</a>. ?And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.?</p> <p>Obama replied that 97 percent of businesses who pay individual rates wouldn?t see their taxes go up. But Romney disputed the relevance of that figure. ?But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half ? half of all the people who work in small business,? he argued. ?Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.?</p> <p>So who?s right? First, the 97 percent figure is if anything an underestimate. According to the <a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3031&#38;topic2ID=60&#38;topic3ID=94&#38;DocTypeID=7"">Tax Policy Center</a>, in 2011 only 1.4 percent of individual filers reporting ?business income? paid the top 33 percent or 35 percent tax rates. The other 98.6 percent either paid the Alternative Minimum Tax (which Obama would <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/03/16/study-buffett-rule-is-no-substitute-for-amt/"">replace</a> with the Buffett rule) or else paid taxes at lower rates, which Obama has said he won?t alter.</p> <p>That said, the 447,000 households paying top rates on business income tend to get more of their income from businesses than those in lower brackets do:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/businessincome_agi.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/businessincome_agi.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>Does this mean 44.5 percent of high-income people own their own small businesses? Not at all. As Derek Thompson <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/08/the-facts-about-small-business-and-the-bush-tax-cut/61023/"">explained</a> when this debate popped up two years ago, ?business income? could include speaking fees, side income from selling wood carvings, part-time consulting, partnership in a law firm and any number of other activities that most wouldn?t categorize as ?owning a small business.?</p> <p>The Treasury Department had some researchers <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/OTA-T2011-04-Small-Business-Methodology-Aug-8-2011.pdf"" target=""_blank"">try to figure out</a> what true small business owners make. It turns out that many of them make nowhere near enough to pay top rates. Only 11 percent of small business owners made more than $200,000, and only 8 percent of small business owners who got at least a quarter of their income that way made that much. Only 4 percent of true small business owners were at the 33 or 35 percent brackets, and would see their taxes go up under Obama.</p> <p>The portion of small business owners paying those rates goes up if you only look at ?employers? ? that is, people whose small businesses had labor costs of over $10,000. Of those people, 10 percent paid the 33 percent and 35 percent rates. But given that there were only five million small business owners with employees under this definition, that amounts to 500,000 people getting a tax increase: hardly a huge change.</p> <p>What about Romney?s claim that businesses with high-earning owners employ more people ? 54 percent, by his estimate? This figure comes from <a href=""http://www.s-corp.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Flow-Through-Report-Final-2011-04-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Robert Carroll and Gerald Prante</a> at the accounting firm Ernst and Young. But this figure includes all income to ?flow-through corporations? ? that is, corporations whose profits are passed along to owners and taxed at normal income tax rates. It thus includes flow-through corporations whose owners pay high rates (such as highly profitable software companies), as well as those that pay much lower rates (such as someone with a part-time freelance consulting businesses). Romney very seriously mischaracterized the population to which this number refers.</p> <p>So will Obama?s tax plan depress hiring among firms organized this way? That?s less clear.  Suppose I?m a small business owner who makes $1 million a year and has $200,000 in payroll. If I fired someone making $100,000 in total compensation today, that would increase my income to $1.1 million, and my after-tax income by $65,000, after I take the top rate of 35 percent off.</p> <p>Now suppose we?re using Obama?s rates. That same firing would only get me $60,400, because of the higher 39.6 percent top rate. So a higher marginal tax rate actually lowers the incentive to fire people and makes hiring look more appealing. Of course, businesses usually hire with the hope that profits go up, and they?ll be less likely to do that with higher marginal rates. But the overall effect on incentives is far from clear.</p> <p>So Romney is right that some small business owners will pay a higher tax rate under Obama?s plan. But that amounts to only 500,000 people, with only about 652,000 employees. The vast majority of small business owners and employees won?t be affected. What?s more, those who are affected might have more reason to hire.</p> <p> <em>Note: the original version of this post misread part of a Treasury table to get an estimate of the number of employees affected by changes in individual rates. It appears there isn?t a reliable estimate from a reputable, so that section has been excise. We apologize for the error.</em> </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24205e48/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544271054/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24205e48/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544271054/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24205e48/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544271054/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24205e48/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

What?s more, you might get the impression that ?this housing crisis is over,? <a href=""http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/10/the-first-presidential-debate/"">writes</a> Jed Kolko, chief economist for Trulia, a real-estate search service.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/help-foreclosure-housing-300x220.jpeg"" /> </p> </p> <p>When housing did come up, Kolko says, it was in the context of how the market has come back (Obama: ?housing has begun to rise?) or how to prevent the next housing crisis through stricter mortgage lending standards (one part of Dodd-Frank that Romney says that he likes).</p> <p>It?s true that there has been a lot of progress made: nationwide, the foreclosure rate is down and home sales have jumped up. But given the severity of the housing crisis, that only puts us<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/florida-foreclosure-inventory-rises-2012-10""> 42 percent</a> of the way back to a housing recovery, according to Kolko?s housing <a href=""http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/09/housing-market-leaps-to-42-back-to-normal/"">barometer</a>; as of August, construction spending was only 27 percent of the way back to normal. And despite <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/business/economy/slow-response-to-housing-crisis-now-weighs-on-obama.html?pagewanted=all"">expanded</a> government refinancing programs, many homeowners are still struggling with payments and remain <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/florida-foreclosure-inventory-rises-2012-10"">at risk</a> of losing their homes.</p> <p>But each candidate had an obvious political motivation not to broach the subject: Obama himself has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/business/economy/slow-response-to-housing-crisis-now-weighs-on-obama.html?pagewanted=all"">admitted</a> that his administration didn?t do enough, quickly enough, to respond to the housing crisis.

Instead, she turned over her crayon to Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin quickly decided that if Barack Obama couldn&rsquo;t suffice as his candidate in a presidential debate, he&rsquo;d call upon a fictional president, Jed Bartlet, for some advice. Thus, an asinine conversation between a TV president and &hellip; well &hellip; a TV president ensued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it channeled exactly what most liberals thought of Obama&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dowd-two-presidents-smoking-and-scheming.html?hp"">debate performance</a>:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET </strong>Were you sleepy?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> Jed &mdash;</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> Was that the problem? Had you just taken allergy medication? General anesthesia?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> I had an off night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> What makes you say that? The fact that the Cheesecake Factory is preparing an ad campaign boasting that it served Romney his pre-debate meal? Law school graduates all over America are preparing to take the bar exam by going to the freakin&rsquo; Cheesecake Factory!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> <em>(following Bartlet inside)</em> I can understand why you&rsquo;re upset, Jed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> Did your staff let you know the debate was gonna be on television?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The left is incensed that Obama did so poorly, and so is Sorkin. Instead of comparing Obama&rsquo;s debate performance to past performances off-teleprompter &ndash; a comparison which would show undeniably that Obama wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;off his game,&rdquo; he never had any game &ndash; Sorkin suggests medication. Which, of course, Sorkin knows a good deal about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA </strong><em>(looking in the other room)</em> Is that Jeff Daniels?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> That&rsquo;s Will McAvoy, he just looks like Jeff Daniels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> Why&rsquo;s he got Jim Lehrer in a hammerlock?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> That&rsquo;s called an Apache Persuasion Hold. McAvoy thinks it&rsquo;s the responsibility of the moderator to expose &mdash; what are they called? &mdash; lies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>WILL</strong> <em>(shouting)</em> Did Obama remove the work requirement from Welfare-to-Work?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><strong>LEHRER</strong> No!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>WILL</strong> And you didn&rsquo;t want to ask Romney about that because? It would&rsquo;ve been impolite?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next liberal trope: it&rsquo;s Lehrer&rsquo;s fault. No, it wasn&rsquo;t. Romney did just fine challenging Obama&rsquo;s lies. Obama had a rough time challenging Romney&rsquo;s truths. As for Obama gutting Welfare-to-Work &hellip; he did <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/09/welfare-work-requirements-vague-replacement-of-work-for-welfare"">exactly that</a>. But the column goes on in this idiotic fashion, suggesting that Romney lied about a non-existent $5 trillion tax cut (even Stephanie Cutter admitted that there was no such tax cut), that Romney lied about Obama raising taxes (even Joe Biden said he would), that Romney lied when he said that Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare (he did), doubled the deficit (he actually <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2012/02/16/obamas-budget-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-american-economy/"">doubled the national debt</a>, not the deficit), etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Liberals are still living in the past, hoping that Bill Clinton will somehow inhabit the body of Barack Obama. But now they&rsquo;re also living in a fictional past, with a fictional president. Here&rsquo;s the dirty little secret about Jed Bartlet: he never faced real opposition, or a real economy. All of it was scripted by Aaron Sorkin. If he&rsquo;d been a real president, he&rsquo;d look a lot like Obama. And he&rsquo;d have been trounced, too.</p>

That having been said, BuzzFeed's Zeke Miller perpetrated one of the worst attempts at guilt by association ever made. Miller attempted to intimate that Mitt Romney is a racist because his motorcade drove past private property that had a Confederate flag flying on it as he campaigned in Virginia.
</p>
<p>You read that right. All Romney did was sit in a car that <em>drove past</em> a Confederate flag and that was something that Miller thought was ""news.""
</p>
<p>Miller made this trenchant observation on his <a href=""https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/254238218126503936"">Twitter feed</a> on October 5.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romney motorcade just passed a hill flying a large confederate flag in rural SW VA
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. Imagine, driving past a Confederate flag in a state that makes millions in tourist money off its intimate connection to American history! Imagine the sheer luck of finding a Confederate flag flying in the one state most associated with the Civil War! Why, the absolute craziness of finding a Confederate flag flying in the state that hosted the Capitol of the Confederate States of America!
</p>
<p>What are the chances?
</p>
<p>And that darn Romney? Shame on him for purposefully sitting in a car that sought out Confederate scenery to drive past. Why, it's proof of any manner of racism. Heck, that car may well have been covered in a white sheet.
</p>
<p>But, maybe Mr. Observant was trying to enrich all our understanding of the lives of the candidates on the road? Maybe he made the same sort of intellectual observations about candidate Obama?
</p>
<p>Ace of Spades wondered that, too and <a href=""http://ace.mu.nu/archives/333549.php"">took a look</a> to see what Zeke ""The Watcher"" Miller had to say about Obama's campaign journey.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pool: Obama insisted on taking a photograph in front of the sign that read ""Michelle's Bakery.""
    </li>
    <li>Obama per pool: "" And she spells it the right way, with two Ls. That&rsquo;s the correct way""
    </li>
    <li>Pool: ""Potus seemed enamored by the shop's name. ""It is no coincidence that I&rsquo;m stopping at Michelle&rsquo;s bakery,""</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the hard-hitting observations that will expose Obama as&hellip; er&hellip; a lover of bakeries named after his wife?
</p>

</p>
<p>Speaking at the offices of the Metro Newspaper in New York where he was acting as a ""global guest editor,"" Branson said that he was part of a commission that spent two years looking at the war on drugs and they came to the conclusion that it is ""<a href=""http://www.metro.us/newyork/national/article/1153435--branson-labels-us-drugs-policy-racist"">patently obvious it's failed</a>.""
</p>
<p>Branson noted that other nations, like Portugal, have made changes to their policies that have helped alleviate their drug problems and suggested that the U.S. follow suit.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>When asked if the U.S. is different, Branson went on a tirade of sorts claiming that the American war on drugs will be harder to change for the better because it's all about racism.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I'll tell you what's different. I'll tell you what the fundamental difference in America is, it, it is a war against black people in America. It's black people that 85 percent of people who go to prison in America for taking drugs is black people. They don't take more drugs, but it's a racist law against black people in America.""
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>""The law should be changed,"" Branson insisted. ""You&rsquo;ve got something like 1.5 million people in American jails languishing for taking drugs and that is wrong. Those people would be much better being out in society, being helped if they have drug problems, getting off the problem.""

</p>
<p>In an interview on NBC's <em>Today</em> show, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed his amazement on the achievement. It's ""just unbelievable,"" said Zuckerberg.
</p>
<p>Facebook and other social media outlets have changed the way we interact, indeed.
</p>
<p>With the watch word of ""be careful what you say,"" all too often what appears on the Internet is hard to erase and relationships and family interaction is frequently marred by hasty social media posts.
</p>
<p>Perhaps even a new form of discrimination is in the offing. Employers are increasingly turning to Facebook, Twitter and the Internet generally to <a href=""http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/04/18/survey-37-of-your-prospective-employers-are-looking-you-up-on-facebook/"">screen out prospective employees</a> before ever even meeting them. Some employers have even taken to requiring prospective employees to hand over passwords to social media accounts so that a review of what the interviewee has posted can be undertaken.
</p>
<p>In any case, as social media grows and new tools are made for its use, more changes are on the way. For now, Facebook's one billion users makes quite a social network.

For twenty years, all 50 states have been reported, but somehow this year the networks and AP are ignoring 19 of them.&nbsp; Now just how and why were those 19 states selected?</p>
<p>The ostensible reason given is the rising cost of the surveys. Dan Merkle, director of elections for ABC News, and a member of the consortium that runs the polls, said the goal &ldquo;is to still deliver a quality product in the most important states.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So just which states are being ignored?&nbsp; Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> tried to gloss over the scheme, noting &ldquo;how carefully the exit poll planners allocated resources. All 19 of the states with no exit polls are classified as either &ldquo;solid Obama&rdquo; or &ldquo;solid Romney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? Of the nineteen states (including Washington, D.C.) exactly <em>4</em> are for Obama, with a total of 14 electoral votes. The fifteen Romney states add up to <em>135.</em></p>
<p>It is utter hogwash that the exit polls were cut from these states because they were in the bag for one of the candidates. If Texas is cut, how about New York and California? </p>
<p>The real reason the consortium has cut these states is that they know that if they report fifteen states coming in for Romney early, independent voters in other states will take notice and be swayed his way.</p>
<p>There is no way that the networks and AP can rationalize their decision without damning themselves with their obvious partisanship. In 2008, the major media outlets were in the tank and lined up for Obama, but it was done under the radar. Now it&rsquo;s all-encompassing. They are goose-stepping in public.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/BS2TP0bNXzg"" width=""1"" />"

<p>MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell grabbed hold of the Obama talking points this morning and attempted to hit Obama surrogate John Sununu with them. The result was the second epic loss for the left in as many days. </p>
<p>You can savor the clip below:</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>...and the corrupt media claims calling a lazy president lazy is racist in 5... 4... 3...</p>
<p>The hustle the media's working here is in the attempt to weaponize&nbsp;the specifics they need to beat Romney&nbsp;to death with.&nbsp;And keep in mind that this is the very&nbsp;same media that got all leg tingley over that detailed two-point&nbsp;2008 plan Obama liked to call&nbsp;""hoping"" and ""changing."" </p>
<p>Romney is exactly right to run on principal without offering up the kind of specifics that Congress will declare dead on arrival. You need room to negotiate. That's how things get done. In 1980, Reagan didn't offer up specifics and that seemed to turn out pretty well. </p>
<p>It's just a fact that we don't vote for presidents based on the wonk; we vote for them based on&nbsp;ideas, ideals, vision, character, and principle. </p>
<p>Furthermore, no one's asking the all-time loser of last night's debate for more details. But that may be because we already know the ""details."" </p>
<p>After all, Obama's only promising more of the same of what failed so miserably these last four years. </p>

It's just a fact that Obama has failed at absolutely everything he's touched -- the stimulus, foreign policy, cash for clunkers, green jobs, the economy, and most especially job creation. Oh, and he sucks so hard at debating that the best one of the worst flaks in media could do was to attempt to <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/04/Stephanopoulos-embarrasses-himself-spins-debate-as-tie"">call last night a draw</a>. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Last night's debate loss was huge, which means Obama's Media Palace Guards are desperate to find a win for the President as quickly as possible. Today's new <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/04/Jobless-Claims-Spike-Stuck-In-Neutral"">jobless numbers</a> certainly didn&rsquo;t fit the bill, but tomorrow's monthly jobs report just might. But like I said, Obama sucks at job creation, which is why the media grades him on such a pathetic curve and is already pre-spinning a win. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">More than once, on CNN and elsewhere, the media is apparently setting the bar for an Obama job creation-win at a paltry, pathetic 100,000. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">""If it's over 100,000 jobs created, that's a win for Obama. If it's under 100,000, that's a loss,"" a CNN analyst said in so many words earlier today. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Only our pathetically corrupt media would consider 100,000 jobs created a month anything but a disaster. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For the sake of context, let's look at what 100,000 jobs mean:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Just for starters, if we're to keep up with population growth, the economy needs to generate anywhere from <a href=""http://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/calculator/index.cfm"">105,000 to 125,000 jobs a month</a>. If all we do is cover this nut, we're treading water. In order to actually create a net-plus number of jobs, we have to do much better than the 100,000 number the media will attempt to paint as victory tomorrow. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Moreover, let's compare Obama's job creation numbers to those of another president who also ""inherited"" a mess -- Ronald Reagan. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">As we all know, Reagan and Obama went about solving the country's economic woes in two entirely different ways. Obama squandered almost a trillion dollars on a stimulus and pushed the federal government into every part of the free market -- from health care to the auto industry. Reagan dramatically lowered taxes and got government out of the American people's way. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In return, under Obama, our economy is shrinking, job creation is below the increase in population, and the deficit looms like a giant meteor headed right&nbsp; for our children and grand children. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Reagan, however, exploded economic growth, kept the deficit manageable, and created jobs -- lots of them. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here are some more apples to apples: At this exact moment in Reagan's presidency (<a href=""http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet"">the 1984 American economy</a> between June and November), created&nbsp; 379k, 312k, 241k, 311k, 286k, and 349k jobs, respectively. It's also worth noting our population was smaller at this time, so the nut to stay ahead was smaller. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">By comparison, not only is the media trying to tell us that a totally unacceptable 100,000 jobs number will be a win&nbsp;for this failed president, but take a look at Obama's job creation this year between the months of June through August: June: <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/07/06/summer-bummer-june-jobs-report-disappoints-at-80k"">80k</a>, July: <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/08/03/Public-Radio-s-Marketplace-Unemployment-Rises-A-Really-Good-Jobs-Report"" target=""_blank"">163k</a>, August: <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/08/173k-food-stamps-96k-new-jobs"">96K</a>&nbsp;(and the June and July numbers together were revised downward by <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/07/Devasting-jobs-report-sept-2012"" target=""_blank"">41k</a>).</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">So only in the media's manufactured reality will 100k jobs created during the entire month of September be anything close to acceptable -- especially after three previous months of not breaking even with population&nbsp;growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But as we already know, the media doesn&rsquo;t care about the poor or the jobless or any American suffering under Obama's failures. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">All they care about is pulling a president promising nothing more than four more years of failure over the finish line based on no higher qualification than the fact he has a ""D"" after his name. </p>

But as to exactly <em>why</em> the President was so taciturn, lackadaisical, distracted, and downright peevish, the media's consensus was, in many cases, silly. In fact, a number of the President's supporters are actually blaming debate moderator, 78-year-old Jim Lehrer.
</p>
<p>The voice closest to the President is that of campaign adviser and TV flack Stephanie Cutter, who was quick to dismiss Lehrer as an unnecessary part of the event. Ladling out her usual blather, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/obamas-cutter-takes-swipe-at-lehrer-137444.html"">Cutter told CNN</a> that ""we feel pretty good about the President's performance here tonight,"" but went on to take a swipe at Lehrer. ""I sometimes wondered if we even needed a moderator because we had Mitt Romney,"" she said.
</p>
<p>But Cutter <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2012/10/04/tough-reviews-for-jim-lehrer-as-debate-moderator"">wasn't alone</a>. HBO's Bill Maher was as blunt as he usually is on his Twitter feed. ""Lehrer sucked,"" he carped.
</p>
<p>Sherri Shepherd, of ABC's <em>The View</em>, tweeted that someone should ""throw a spitball"" at Lehrer.
</p>
<p>The Huffington Post's main Twitter feed wasn't too happy about Lehrer's work, either, saying: ""Mitt Romney and Barack Obama moderated this debate. Where was Jim Lehrer?""
</p>
<p>In her post-debate wrap up on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow said that Romney spent a lot of time battling both the President <em>and</em> Lehrer. ""Romney won every exchange,"" she noted ruefully.
</p>
<p>Maddow had <a href=""http://www.mediaite.com/tv/maddow-no-winner-in-this-debate-but-there-is-a-loser-jim-lehrer/"">other words</a> for Lehrer, too. ""I do believe that we saw this debate format die a very painful death on camera tonight... the format and, I think, the moderator, honestly, with all due respect to Jim Lehrer,"" she said.
</p>
<p>Normally mild-mannered Al Roker of NBC's <em>Today</em> <a href=""https://twitter.com/alroker/status/253683154756448257"">took a shot at Lehrer</a> on his own Twitter feed. ""I hope Jim Lehrer gets the license plate of the truck that drove over him in this debate,"" he joked.
</p>
<p>Some wag even started a new Twitter account with the name ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/silentjimlehrer"">Silent Jim Lehrer</a>.""
</p>
<p>Speaking of Twitter, Poynter has a <a href=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/190523/jim-lehrer-target-of-media-criticism-while-moderating-his-12th-presidential-debate/"">nice rundown of jabs and slams</a> of moderator Lehrer from such celebrities as Conan O'Brien, Bill Maher, the Onion, Michael Moore, various news folks and others, all slamming Lehrer as the man who wasn't there.
</p>
<p>It is pretty amusing, if not a bit ironic, that all these leftists are attacking a card-carrying member of the left-wing media, isn't it? The left loves the Old Media until it does something they feel is counter to their narrative. In this case, though, it's like blaming a referee because a team lost by three touchdowns.
</p>
<p>Some reports earlier this year claimed the debate commission had to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/us/criticism-greets-list-of-debate-moderators.html?_r=2&amp;ref=politics"">coax Lehrer out of retirement</a> to do this debate. He initially refused to do it but eventually relented and accepted the role. One might guess that Lehrer won't make the mistake of leaving retirement for a debate again.
</p>
<p>Finally, for his part, former Vice President Al Gore had a <a href=""http://www.mediaite.com/tv/al-gore-blames-denvers-high-altitude-for-obamas-lackluster-debate-performance/"">completely different</a>, but no more logical, excuse for the President&rsquo;s loss last night. Gore blamed Denver&rsquo;s high altitude!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I&rsquo;m going to say something controversial here,"" Gore began ""Obama arrived in Denver at 2 p.m. today &ndash; just a few hours before the debate started. Romney did his debate prep in Denver. When you go to 5,000 feet, and you only have a few hours to adjust &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;""
</p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here's a transcript of the exchange between co-anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos who anchored ABC News' post-debate coverage. This occurred even before Obama, Romney, and their families had left the debate stage: &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">DIANE SAWYER: Let me turn to you right now, George, nobody knows politics better than you. Here it is, bottom line, was there a clear winner tonight?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS:&nbsp; I think Governor Romney was definitely more crisp in his presentation. He was leaning into the debate when President Obama was a little bit more laid back. I think he was able to be aggressive without being offensive. So, even though there were -- I didn't see any knockout punches. No breakthrough moments or major mistakes. I think Governor Romney will get the boost that challengers usually get. The big question, did he do anything to dramatically change the trajectory of the race?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">SAWYER:&nbsp; [after some chatter about Twitter reactions to Romney's comments about Big Bird] I want to turn to Matthew Dowd, a key strategist for both sides of the aisle, at different points in his life. Is George right?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">MATTHEW DOWD:&nbsp; Well, I think this -- we all try to make comparisons to these races to previous presidential races and this race has been so eerily familiar to 2004 and tonight was another example of that. it is as if -- very much like Bush-Kerry. Bush came in with a lead, not huge, he came in to play for a draw and John Kerry came in to win. The exact same happened tonight. Mitt Romney came in to win this debate with passion and it looked as if the president came in, as long as I play for a draw, I keep a lead and go forward. If that's the case, I think a very close race just got a lot closer.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">SAWYER:&nbsp; Really? Played for a draw and succeeded?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">DOWD:&nbsp; No, the president played for a draw, but the guy that comes in and plays for a win usually gets the victory.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">STEPHANOPOLOUS:&nbsp; Does a tie go to the challenger?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Last night was easily the most decisive and crushing debate performance in the history of presidential debates. And yet, Stephanopoulos (a Democratic operative disguised as a news man) immediately attempted to spin an obvious and devastating loss for Obama into a &hellip;. draw. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But none of this is surprising. We all saw it coming a mile away. Last night, Stephanopoulos <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/ABC-s-Stephanopoulos-Attempts-to-Torpedo-Romney-s-Debate-Performance-Ahead-of-Time"">tee'd up his spin before the debate</a> and he also has an <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/Media-Watch-Stephanopolous-Debate-Winner"">almost perfect record</a> of immediately spinning debate victories for Democrats. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Think about how pathetic and partisan George Stephanopoulos really is. Even his Clinton-era colleague James Carville (who doesn&rsquo;t disguise himself as a journalist) admitted Romney ate Obama's lunch last night. But Stephanopoulos is so partisan and so corrupt and such a propagandist liar that even in the face of an undeniable reality he just couldn't bring himself to acknowledge it. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">If we were in anything resembling a just world, I would suggest to ABC News that, for the sake of their own credibility, they take a long hard look at how bad Stephanopoulos makes the entire franchise look. But that's not the world we live in. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">ABC News hired and elevated Stephanopoulos to do exactly what he did last night -- and like a good little flak, Georgie-boy once again sacrificed whatever's left of his reputation and credibility to the pagan god of The State. </p>

""This isn't the Mitt Romney the media's presented to me over the last six months.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Free of the corrupt media's filter; free of the spin, the lying fact-checkers, the gotchas, and the desperate effort to cover up any and all bad news that might hurt Obama -- by every standard, every measure, every opinion, and every opinion poll, what we witnessed last night at the first presidential debate of 2012 was a commanding, dominating blow-out performance by Governor Mitt Romney. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Last night the GOP contender showed up to kick butt and chew bubblegum, but unfortunately for &nbsp;Barack Obama, Romney was all out of bubblegum. The real loser, though, was a corrupt mainstream media that had just spent months desperately crafting a Mitt Romney that doesn't exist -- a Mitt Romney voters would not find acceptable as president.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We've all seen what's happened month after month after month after month: Obama's Media Palace Guards have assured us that Romney can do nothing right and Obama can do nothing wrong. This carefully crafted media game-plan (coordinated openly with the Obama campaign) was meant to strip Romney of the single quality voters demand in a president, and that's competence. &nbsp;If you're not competent, you&rsquo;re not an acceptable alternative, which means we're going to vote for ""the devil we know.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But last night all of this blew up in the media's face, and this morning the American people trust the media even less than they did the night before -- and for one very simple reason: they were lied to &hellip; again. Where was the bumbling, elitist, out of touch, awkward, wife-killing, gay-hating, corporate vulture who tortures dogs and stumbles through Europe like Chevy Chase in a ""Vacation"" sequel? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Well, he didn&rsquo;t show up last night because that's not who Mitt Romney is. <em>That</em> Mitt Romney is a media creation manufactured out of lies and desperation by those who spend 24 hours a day crafting trip wires, fabricating gaffes, and standing before the elephant of Barack Obama's failures and asking, ""What elephant?""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For all of moderator Jim Lehrer's flaws last night, the 78-year-old semi-retired PBS newsman did the only thing we conservatives ask of the media: he mostly stayed out of the way and offered up a fairly level playing field. There were no gotcha questions and no &nbsp;<em>What about your gaaaaaffes? &nbsp;</em>To his great credit (though he did try to rescue the president more than once), Lehrer kept the debate in an arena no liberal can win in --and that's on the issues. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Unlike his cretin colleagues, Lehrer was actually interested in the issues that matter. So he asked about taxes, job creation, education, the deficit, and an overall governing philosophy. In other words, he didn't stack the deck to distract from what a horrible philosophy big government liberalism really is. With a rare opportunity like this, if you&rsquo;re smart, prepared and all out of bubblegum, a conservative can win any debate. Obviously, Mitt Romney not only won last night, he delivered the kind of satisfying drubbing to Barack Obama we conservatives have been waiting four years to savor. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Yes, someone finally was given and took full advantage of the opportunity to point to that little emperor and say to the world, ""Look, he's naked!""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And now the lying, biased, corrupt, degenerate mainstream media has a problem on its hands. Because now the whole world knows that they were not only pointing to clothes that didn&rsquo;t exist but also attempting to destroy anyone who dared cry ""Naked!""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In ninety short but delicious and unforgettable minutes, Mitt Romney not only exposed President FailureTeleprompter as the churlish, entitled failure he truly is -- he also destroyed the caricature our thoroughly corrupted media institutions had built around him. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Romney's commanding victory was Reaganesque, and so is the result. In 1980, the media did everything in its power to &nbsp;scare voters away from Ronald Reagan by portraying him as a scary warmonger. But during his first and only debate with then-President Jimmy Carter, Reagan proved the media a liar. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This is exactly what Romney did last night, but unfortunately, he has two more debates ahead of him. This means that the media has two more kicks at the cat to rescue Obama, and Romney had better be prepared, because the push is already on to ensure he <strong>is</strong> asked, <em>What about your gaaaafffes? </em></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Even though Obama enjoyed four more minutes to speak than Romney, immediately after last night's debate, the left marched in unison to blame the moderator for not <em>controlling things</em> enough. And this makes perfect sense. Leftists know they can't win on a level playing field. But if the referee <em>takes control</em>, &nbsp;victory can be had!</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This means that for the two upcoming debates, Romney had better be prepared for questions about his dog, Bain, gaffes, wealth, taxes, high school bullying, perfect hair, the mole that wasn't there before, and his disastrously racist victory over Obama in the last debate.<em></em></p>

<p>
NBC fired a ""seasoned"" producer and two other employees after an internal investigation. It's being <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/nbc_sued_over_trayvon_tape_oVUCWcX6E8sU8FLDxAvHy"">reported</a> that ""Zimmerman&rsquo;s attorneys are ... naming news president Steve Capus and correspondent Ron Allen, who was the reporter on the scene for the broadcast on &ldquo;Today&rdquo; on March 27."" Indications are that the NBC has informed&nbsp;employees&nbsp;involved of the suit, instructing them to not comment to the media.</p>
<p>
The misleading edit made it appear as though the fact that Martin was black was somehow significant to Zimmerman, when in fact, he only mentioned it in response to a question from the 911 dispatcher.</p>
<p>

<p>The Empty Chair has better odds in Round Two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buster Douglas was better prepared for his fight against Evander Holyfield. Buster came to Vegas, took naps at the golf course, spend evenings at the buffets and decided not to train for his only Heavyweight Championship defense. It ended in a third-round knockout. Not sure if Barack Obama failed to train while spending 3 days here in Las Vegas before his debate, but if he did, he's in more trouble than anybody knows.</p>
<p>Certainly, most people who come to Vegas and spend three days here, expect to leave losers, but not this bad. I've seen a lot of Presidential Debates in my lifetime and never has there been a bigger blowout. At least some people who listened on radio thought Nixon beat JFK. You could've listened through a string and cup and the conclusion would've been the same. Romney by KO.</p>
<p>As the media searches, questions, wonders and freaks out (didya see MSNBC?) over why Mitt Romney smacked Barack Obama silly on Wednesday night, there are two simple answers---1) Romney has truth and facts and Obama is armed with failure, 2) the media lobbing non-stop softballs has left Obama totally unprepared. &nbsp;Obama's friends in the Activist Old Media bear much of the blame for the Denver Disaster 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it---at every turn Romney has been challenged, badgered, questioned, and queried over and over again and he has been forced to come up with answers. As it should be. Republicans know the game and it is not a level playing field. Obama has been coddled, protected, babied, and fed pablum by his media and when finally challenged, he fails miserably.</p>
<p>Yes, the media's game plan for Obama Victory 2012 has backfired miserably. It's just Round One in a Five Round debate season, but there were times when I almost felt sorry for Obama on that stage. Almost. Jim Lehrer finished second on this night mainly because he fed Obama better answers than Obama gave himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Romney still has Fast and Furious and Benghazi in his quiver. He fired Solyndra with laser-like accuracy.</p>
<p>The Veeps are up next. I'm making Paul Ryan a 14 and a half point favorite. Early money is coming big on Ryan. This line will be -17 by kickoff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>""He choked. He lost,"" Sullivan continued. ""He may even have lost the election tonight.""</p>
<p>In his final live blog update, Sullivan lamented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look: you know how much I love the guy, and you know how much of a high information viewer I am, and I can see the logic of some of Obama's meandering, weak, professorial arguments. But this was a disaster for the president for the key people he needs to reach, and his effete, wonkish lectures may have jolted a lot of independents into giving Romney a second look...</p>
<p>The person with authority on that stage was Romney - offered it by one of the lamest moderators ever, and seized with relish. This was Romney the salesman. And my gut tells me he sold a few voters on a change tonight. It's beyond depressing. But it's true.</p>
<p>There are two more debates left. I have experienced many times the feeling that Obama just isn't in it, that he's on the ropes and not fighting back, and then he pulls it out. He got a little better over time tonight. But he pulled every punch. Maybe the next two will undo some of the damage. But I have to say I think it was extensive.</p>

<div>Chuck Todd said on NBC Nightly News tonight that the Obama campaign does not want to make the mistake George W. Bush made against John Kerry in 2004 in their first debate. Kerry did well in that debate and got a 6-7-point bump after. Todd said that is why Obama has prepared considerably for this debate and is taking it seriously. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That is not what the mainstream media has been telling us this week, though. The mainstream media has been reporting that Obama could be too busy with national security issues to adequately prepare. These reports&nbsp;deliberately tried to lower expectations for him.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, it seems that Obama has been preparing more than his team or the mainstream media has been letting on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course, this should not come as a surprise to anyone. Of course a president whose re-election chances hang in the balance will fully prepare for this debate. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So it leaves one to ask: Is the mainstream media&nbsp;stupid enough to fall for the Obama campaign's spin or simply dishonest and&nbsp;knowingly spinning facts they know are not true?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Probably both. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>CBS Evening News Sets Romney Up For Failure -- Tony Lee</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Right off the bat, CBS Evening News both sets high expectations for Romney and makes it seem like Romney is a candidate on the ropes, even though a recent <em>National Journal</em> Poll had Romney and Obama tied, and Romney has been gaining in swing states like Virginia and Florida, in addition to leading polls of swing states by respected polling organizations. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the lead-in, CBS showed two clips.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first is Obama saying that ""Gov. Romney has shown himself to be a very good debater.""</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The next clip is Scott Pelley asking Romney, ""Do you think the debates are make-or-break for you?""</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CBS wants the viewer to think Romney is a good debater and that he's on the ropes. CBS is trying to give Romney less room for error in the mainstream media's ""expectations game."" </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Corrupt Media's Spin Will Begin Tonight On Twitter </strong></p>
<p>Tonight will be the first ever presidential debate in the age of Twitter. This means the corrupt media will be using the social media device to signal and coordinate plans of attack Romney. Whatever narratives are set tonight will not be set on the stage or in the post-debate spin room. Tonight's narrative will be set by a member of the corrupt media tweeting something&nbsp;other members of the corrupt media feel they can latch on to in order to declare Obama&nbsp;a Sun God.</p>
<p>Our job in New Media is to be on Twitter fighting this, and doing what we can to get ahead of it. </p>

<p>The 2007 Times Picayune article began like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re desperate, out of options, have nowhere else to turn, Brandon Darby wants you to call him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Really.&nbsp; He handed me a business card with his new toll-free number on it and asked me to spread the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think using the director&rsquo;s number as a help line is kind of unusual,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Brandon is Operations Director for Common Ground Relief, a grassroots group that formed in the first days after Katrina and keeps evolving to meet the needs of the New Orleans area.</p>
<p>The volunteers are probably best known for gutting houses, but they&rsquo;re helping people rebuild their lives in many ways.</p>
<p>Brandon is a &ldquo;buck stops here&rdquo; kind of guy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why he wanted his number to be the helpline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are solutions to almost every problem if we know what the problem is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, that article is nowhere to be found online.&nbsp; Like so many others regarding Darby before and after it in the media world, the article seems to have fallen down the memory hole, to be disappeared forever.</p>
<p>A cursory search of LexisNexis rediscovers the article, however.&nbsp; The full piece is offered here for your own reading pleasure. </p>

<p>Instead, what appears in its place are a series of articles that seem to be an exercise in history revisionism &ndash; articles by the same author, posted by the same publication, and the name Brandon Darby has been eradicated from existence.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Regular readers at Breitbart News recognize Brandon Darby as a fellow Breitbart contributor. A former left-wing activist, Darby was once a familiar face on the grassroots scene in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA.&nbsp; In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Darby formed Common Ground Relief with three others.</p>
<p>But that all began to change in 2008.</p>
<p>Darby turned to the FBI when he recognized that a colleague of his at the time, Riad Hamad, was attempting to funnel money from Hamad&rsquo;s Palestinian nonprofit organization, The Palestine Children's Welfare Fund (PCWF), to aid enemies of Israel.&nbsp; Hamad had been suggesting a visit to the Middle East that included proposals of violence.&nbsp; Darby refused and was content to let the issue go, but when he realized that Hamad continued to try and convince others to join him instead, Darby knew that he had to inform law enforcement to stop that plan.</p>
<p>Soon after, Darby found himself working undercover as an informant with the FBI&rsquo;s Joint Terrorism Task Force, when activists from a fringe left group the FBI termed as the &ldquo;Austin Affinity Group&rdquo; - &ndash; which included David McKay and Bradley Neal Crowder - plotted to utilize explosive devices at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>The details of just how involved and dangerous the Austin Affinity Group&rsquo;s plans were can be seen in this 2009 press release issued by the <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/minneapolis/press-releases/2009/mp052109a.htm"">Minneapolis Division of the FBI</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation, McKay was arrested by the St. Paul Police Department during the execution of a search warrant on Sept. 3 at a residence on Dayton Avenue. Police found eight assembled Molotov cocktails in the basement. They consisted of bottles filled with gasoline with an attached wick made from tampons.</p>
<p>According to trial testimony, the FBI in Texas began investigating the group, labeled by law enforcement as the Austin Affinity Group, in February 2008. McKay and Crowder were members of the group.</p>
<p>McKay admitted that on Aug. 28, 2008, he, Crowder and other members of the Austin Affinity Group traveled from Austin, Texas, to Minnesota. The group brought a rental trailer with them that contained 35 riot shields, made from stolen traffic barrels. The intended use of the shields was to help demonstrators block streets near the Xcel Energy Center in order to prevent convention delegates from safely reaching the convention. St. Paul Police seized these shields on Aug. 31.</p>
<p>According to trial testimony, McKay and Crowder, angered by the loss of the shields, purchased supplies for constructing Molotov cocktails at a St. Paul Wal-Mart on Aug. 31, including a gas can, motor oil and tampons. They also purchased gasoline at a gas station. They then manufactured the eight Molotov cocktails at an apartment on Dayton Avenue where they were staying.</p>
<p>Law enforcement learned through an informant that McKay and Crowder had manufactured the Molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>During a conversation overheard by law enforcement through electronic surveillance on Sept. 2, McKay told an informant that he intended to throw the Molotov cocktails at police vehicles parked in a lot near the Dayton Avenue apartment. The parking lot was used as a checkpoint area for vehicles entering the security perimeter around the convention site. It was visibly patrolled by the U.S. Secret Service, various police agencies and the military.</p>
<p>During the execution of a search warrant by the St. Paul Police Department at the Dayton Avenue residence where McKay was staying when he was arrested, officers seized a variety of items, including gas masks, slingshots, helmets and knee pads. Under the kitchen sink, officers discovered a two-gallon gasoline container identical to the one purchased by McKay at the WalMart on Aug. 31. In the basement of the residence, officers found eight assembled Molotov cocktails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/106481018/090808-Mckay-Affidavit"">full affidavit</a> that was filed by FBI Special Agent Christopher Langert in the state of Minnesota for the case, McKay had expressed no concerns that a cop could potentially be inside one of the cars they planned to hit with Molotov cocktails, and remarked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth it if an officer gets burned or maimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Darby publicly revealed his role as an informant and his involvement in the arrests eventually became clear, there was a coordinated effort to push the narrative that the activists were victims of entrapment, at the hands of Darby.&nbsp; But in the same press release from the <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/minneapolis/press-releases/2009/mp052109a.htm"">Minneapolis Division of the FBI</a>, it was revealed by a judge that such charges were false.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s sentence included a finding by Judge Davis that McKay obstructed justice at his January trial by falsely accusing a government informant, Brandon Darby, of inducing him to manufacture the Molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>Judge Davis told McKay that while it was acceptable for people to peacefully protest, McKay&rsquo;s activities took him down a different path, one of anarchy. &ldquo;I saw you on the videotape,&rdquo; Judge Davis added, referring to evidence shown of McKay during a recording of a violent protest. &ldquo;You were leading the charge. You and Crowder were coming up here (to Minnesota) to do anarchy against the system.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darby had ultimately decided to come forth and testify against one of the two bomb makers. Admittedly, this seemed an awkward place for Darby &ndash; not only had he been part of the activist left, but like many others in the New Orleans area, he hadn&rsquo;t always placed his trust entirely with law enforcement personnel. &nbsp;But as Darby&rsquo;s concerns about radicalism in the activist left grew, as did his relationship with the FBI, he began to realize that those around him for all these years did not reflect the principles or the political viewpoints he truly espoused.</p>
<p>Darby was named as the key witness in a related case on December 29th, 2008.&nbsp; The New York Times went into <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/05informant.html"">narrative changing mode</a> &ndash; rather than focusing on the alleged crimes of Darby&rsquo;s fellow activists and the physical evidence detailed in the FBI reports, the newspaper instead focused on the perceived betrayal by Darby in the eyes of leftist activist circles. &nbsp;Almost overnight, posters sprung up all across communities in which Darby lived, denouncing him. </p>
<p>In all the scorn of Darby from activists and media on the left, the narrative that eventually came to be was a false one.&nbsp; It neglected one of the single most important admissions made by defendant David McKay to the court in his second trial:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=45694662"">he lied about Brandon Darby</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""My belief was that Brad [Crowder] was going to say something that was not true to protect himself,"" he told [Judge] Davis. But he admitted that he'd done the same thing. ""I embellished -- I guess actually lied -- that Brandon Darby came up with the idea to make Molotov cocktails.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darby&rsquo;s FBI involvement was neither celebrated nor appreciated by activists and media on the left. Though thousands of activists had come through Darby&rsquo;s Common Ground organization in New Orleans, many of them bloggers, not one negative story about him or his character had surfaced in the multitude of media stories that existed about him or his organization <strong>prior</strong> to the public revelation of his FBI involvement.</p>
<p>But now, all of Darby&rsquo;s prior accomplishments were taken from him. </p>
<p>Lisa Fithian, the infamous Occupy organizer and paid labor union agitator, began claiming that Darby was only &ldquo;nominally involved&rdquo; in New Orleans and hadn&rsquo;t co-founded Common Ground Relief at all, a statement that even fellow organizer Malik Rahim &ndash; who himself was disappointed to learn of Darby&rsquo;s informant status - disputed in the same January 6, 2009 <a href=""http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/6/prominent_austin_activist_admits_he_infiltrated"">Democracy Now interview</a>. Fithian portrayed Darby as a sex-fiend who hated women, never acknowledging Darby&rsquo;s role in founding a women&rsquo;s shelter. Another Common Ground Relief co-founder, Scott Crow, denounced Darby and claimed he didn&rsquo;t start the organization, despite having publicly credited Darby as a co-founder previously.</p>
<p>The facts that were presented by Darby, and subsequently the FBI, jeopardized the image that the broader movement had been trying to portray for itself - that it was a movement of non-violence.&nbsp; In order to save face, they would have to change the narrative.&nbsp; Darby was recharacterized, reinvented by his fellow activists - not as someone who did the right thing in the face of a difficult situation, but as someone who preyed on helpless young activists on the left and actively &ldquo;infiltrated&rdquo; and &ldquo;entrapped&rdquo; them into breaking the law.</p>
<p>Unable to defend himself against this revisionism due to the upcoming trial, Darby&rsquo;s character was smeared and damaged in what appeared to be a concerted effort to discredit his testimony against the accused activists.</p>
<p><img alt="""" height=""425"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2012/10/03/BrandonDarby-poster1.jpg"" width=""355"" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brandon Darby was labeled a &ldquo;snitch&rdquo; and since 2008, his story has been revised and retold time and time again by many on the left.&nbsp; To this day, he endures countless attacks on his character, many of them citing the false representation of the facts in that trial.&nbsp; Despite whatever other history may have existed amongst Darby&rsquo;s circle of activists before this time, the facts are in the court documents &ndash; something that media rarely highlighted.</p>
<p>And so this began much of the revisionism that we see today in Darby&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; Not only have negative stories been plastered about him all across the internet, including a New York Times article that prompted Darby to sue the publication for defamation in March of 2011, but we now see another instance of a positive piece that accurately depicted Darby and his work with the Common Ground Relief and Women&rsquo;s Shelter has been scrubbed from the internet.</p>
<p>This turn of events initiated the life-changing transformation of Darby&rsquo;s conversion from political left to right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken with Brandon Darby about this time in his life, and about his political conversion.&nbsp; He maintains that not much about him as a person has changed &ndash; he&rsquo;s always believed in leveraging fellow members of the surrounding community to provide assistance to those in need &ndash; but the people with whom Darby surrounds himself has.&nbsp; While he once thought that the left stood for his ideals, his personal experience has taught him that he saw the right in a false portrayal.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s since found that other activists and organizations on the right have been a far more suitable fit for his ideology and his goals.&nbsp; When I asked Brandon how he reconciled this shift, he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life provided me with experiences many don't get to have. I was able to participate in basically being ""the government"" in Katrina's aftermath until actual governmental agencies returned. I was able to actually work with and see the character of many of the Left's heroes and leaders; I was able to taste the fruit of left-of-center methodologies. The result was an appreciation for our system of checks and balances, how it was institutionalized. I began to think it strange that others called for more of people relying on governmental aid. I began to feel the solutions were in less governmental control of lives and more of personal responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darby&rsquo;s story is unfortunately not all that uncommon.&nbsp; Others at times have also found themselves in his shoes.&nbsp; Too often, the facts don&rsquo;t fit the narrative, and invested parties &ndash; including media &ndash; will rewrite their own.&nbsp; I suppose some may see this post as doing the same.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s balance.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/zrpLJc9w1VE"" width=""1"" />"

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Once the Daily Caller story did hit, and it became clear that Tucker Carlson <strong>had</strong> found never-before-seen video of Obama in a way voters have never seen him, none of that mattered. The desperate narrative to protect Obama had already been set and, as though the rest of us were insane, the corrupt media doubled down in its efforts to tell those of us who had never seen this video that we had. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Of course, it's all lies &ndash;&nbsp;blatant lies meant to control the explosion of an explosive story, meant to justify why the very same media still obsessed over Romney's ""47 percent"" moment will now downplay and ignore as a nothingburger Obama caught on video spewing racialist division and the kind of wild conspiracy theories a sitting U.S. Senator had to know weren't true. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But New Media is The Media, and this video will get disseminated and voters will see it. And like Romney's ""47 percent"" moment, this new Obama video is a legitimate news story worth covering. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here are ten reasons why&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>1. The video released by the Daily Caller last night does include footage the media never broadcast or reported on.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Furthermore, we're supposed to believe it's just a coincidence that the footage the media ignored just happens to be the most controversial part, where Barack Obama (who at the time was running to be the Democratic nominee for president) goes off-script and tells a majority black audience that the federal government doesn't care about Hurricane Katrina victims because they're black. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Even Politico's mainstream media water-carrier Dylan Byers had <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/obamas-speech-how-they-covered-it-137319.html?hp=l1_b3"">to admit</a> this is the case:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">But the full footage of the speech included previously unreported remarks in which Sen. Obama suggested that the federal government helped victims of 9/11 and Hurricane Andrew (in Florida), but did not help the victims of Hurricane Katrina because it didn't care about them as much.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">By any measure, new video of a sitting president sewing seeds of racial division is not only news, but big news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">If this were Allen West giving the exact same speech, you better believe it would be everywhere. And he's only a congressman. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>2. Now we know the media and the Obama campaign ""selectively edited"" the video in 2007 in order to cover up Obama's divisive racial rhetoric.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's most certainly news.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>3. Past is prologue. Always.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obama's attacks on the suburbs and the ""us vs. them"" rhetoric that toxifies the entire speech helps make sense of his divisive presidency and campaign. Moreover, the speech that made Obama a national star was his 2004 address at the Democratic Convention where he was famously unifying and post-racial. That was his ""no red states, no blue states"" speech. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Now we know the 2004 speech was bull shit. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Obama grew up in Hawaii and Chicago, so where in the world does that hilariously fake southern accent come from?</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Like a lot of politicians, depending on the audience he's with, this president can be a huge phony. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">I'm a news and political junkie and never once have I heard him speak with this pronounced a southern accent. So&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news to me, and probably to a lot of people. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>5. In order to stoke racial division and resentment, Obama lied to his audience.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The then-U.S. Senator tells the audience that the federal government waived the Stafford Act for New York after 9/11 and for Florida after Hurricane Andrew, but not for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/02/obama-speech-jeremiah-wright-new-orleans/2/"">was a lie</a>: </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">[T]he federal government did at times waive the Stafford Act during its reconstruction efforts. On May 25, 2007, just weeks before the speech, the Bush administration sent an additional $6.9 billion to Katrina-affected areas with no strings attached.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">As a sitting United States Senator, Obama must have been aware of this. And yet he spent 36 minutes at the pulpit telling a mostly black audience that the U.S. government doesn&rsquo;t like them because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Which leads me to&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>6. Obama is prone to believing and spreading dishonest and wildly false conspiracy theories.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">You know, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUzLpO1kxI"">like Kanye West</a>. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>7.</strong> <strong>At the 19:20 mark we learn that the Christian Obama doesn't know the Lord's Prayer.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Obama's ""us vs. them"" rhetoric and beliefs extends to his governance.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;At the 28:50 mark, Obama talks extensively about the importance of minority-owned businesses and supporting your own. He then proposes using the Small Business Administration specifically to aid minorities. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>9.</strong> <strong>At the 20:10 mark, Obama laments the social injustice that created 37 million Americans living in poverty and pledges to fight that injustice as president.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">After four years of Obamanomics, we now <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/us-poverty-census_n_1877197.html"">have 10 million more Americans living in poverty. </a></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>10.</strong> &nbsp;<strong>When Obama gave this speech, the Reverend Wright scandal had yet to break. </strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This means that the scant, incomplete, and ""selectively edited"" coverage the speech received at the time wouldn't have thought much of the full minute Obama spends gushing over his mentor and pastor in his opening remarks. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Knowing what we know now makes this, yes, news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">----</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The corrupt media knows this newly released footage is news. They just don't want voters to see Obama for what he is: a phony, divisive, racial demagogue and grievance-monger ready to spread lies, conspiracy theories, and animosity in order to get what he wants.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Oh, I almost forgot&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>11.</strong> <strong>We know it's news because the corrupt media is telling us there's nothing to see here, even as they kill themselves to blow it back on Romney&nbsp;and ensure as few people as possible see it.</strong>&nbsp; </p>

It is also leftist and predictable, but that would be three things.</p>
<p>So, here we go with a prediction born of the leftist transparency we find with the Activist Old Media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime after November 7th the media will begin doing its job. Now...it still won't<em> fully</em> do it's job, but it will at least give it the ol' College Journalism School Try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two scandals should be rocking this White House right now. By themselves, each is worse than Watergate, and combined they would make Barack Obama the most scandalous president in history. Fast and Furious, the Benghazi terrorist attack; and lies and cover-ups with both.</p>
<p>There is an election to win right now for the media and its Dear Leader, so neither scandal will get the attention it deserves. We know that, we see that. Oh...they may touch on these stories and bite around the edges, but the junk yard dogs sit muzzled and chained while the Obama administration has its way with the merchandise (in this case, <em>we</em> would be the merchandise.) Never forget this is the same media that spent four years, <em>four years</em> attacking the George W. Bush White House over the supposed leaking of a non-covert CIA agent's name. A story the media got horribly wrong, but oh well, the Bushies had it comin'.</p>
<p>Whether Obama wins or loses this election, the media will suddenly learn of these two stories through osmosis (or they will click into Big Government and read them) and they will cover them as if they knew them all along. They will try to maintain a smidgen of credibility. Investigative reporters will be unleashed, books will be written, and Peabody's and Emmy's will be awarded en-mass.</p>
<p>If Obama loses November 6th, the media will have ignored its motto of ""speaking truth to power"" because Obama will be out of power. It does little good then. The time to do these stories is <em>now.</em> Right now. But clearly the media feel loose seats on an American Airlines jet where nobody was hurt is more important. Gotta protect our viewers from possibly bumping their heads---but 4 dead in Benghazi and 300  killed in Fast and Furious will have to wait (oh, plus the lies and cover-ups, remember with Watergate it was the lies and cover-ups that were worse.) There was no desire by the media to tell the voting public who Obama was in 2008, why would they suddenly do it in 2012? They will not, they have not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Obama wins November 6th (heaven help us---no really, heaven help us) the media will do what it has done to the second-terms of the most recent presidents in memory. The media will exert its power and make sure <em>that</em> president knows that<em> they</em> are in charge. &nbsp;Never forget, as much as they love Obama, they love themselves and their power more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second-term scandals, real or perceived are the reality. Nixon-Watergate, Reagan-Iran Contra, Clinton-Monica, Bush-Just being alive. Historians have argued that presidents get cocky in their second terms and that leads to their demise, and part of that is true, but the Obama scandals have been uncovered in his<em> first</em> term. I shutter to think what scandals might become us if he gets four more years. I haven't even mentioned the scandals of where the ""stimulus"" dollars were spent.</p>
<p>The Activist Old Media will do these stories and they will want credit for doing them. They will tell themselves how tough they were on Obama and they will point to the awards on their shelves as proof. Of course, we know the truth. When these stories needed to be done the junk yard dogs sat silent, by choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are still a few weeks left to cover these scandals when they matter most, but the media will not. They would've by now. The facts are out there <em>now</em> and it will matter little when they report them later. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have muzzled and chained themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amidst all the pre-spin build up to the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney, Lehrer is being overlooked as a key player in tonight's made-for-TV reality show. Make no mistake, the PBS journalist will be just as important to the proceedings as the height of the podiums and the color of the neckties. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the laughable expectations game put forth by the mainstream media that has somehow positioned Mitt Romney as the finest debater since Socrates and Barack Obama as a fledgling dolt barely capable of putting two sentences together, the fact is Obama has an enormous built-in advantage tonight. And that advantage will be sitting at a desk looking up at him the entire ninety minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehrer told the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/us/politics/debate-moderators-are-subject-to-partisan-rancor.html?hp&amp;_r=0""><em>New York Times</em></a> he was ""outraged"" over criticism of his choice to moderate the first debate. The paper of record described him as ""seething"" over the suggestion that perhaps America could have been served better by a different choice this time around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>""I&rsquo;m susceptible to the same smears as anyone else,"" he told the paper of record. Yes Jim, you are. But to many Americans, those you might not always come in contact with during your commute to the PBS studios, focusing on your history of slanted and offensive questions during the presidential debates does not constitute a ""smear."" It is better described as critical observation used to hold a journalist accountable -- especially a journalist entrusted with such an important job as facilitating a forum of ideas between the two people vying to become the leader of the free world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So to that end, we present the Breitbart News analysis of Jim Lehrer's greatest hits. We call it: ""30 Years of  Presidential Debates Liberal Bias."" The clips we've found are not just confined to Lehrer's performance during the debates. You see, Mr. Lehrer has enjoyed the opportunity to speak before many college groups about his experiences as presidential moderator. We're sure the reader won't be shocked to discover that he has plenty of ridicule to dole out to the Republican candidates he encountered and tons of praise for the Democrats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please enjoy it and keep this in mind as you watch tonight's debate. The moderator is far from moderate. He's a progressive. And that's why he got the gig. &nbsp;</p>

"490","http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BigJournalism/~3/6_tcw5PgWdo/Big-Three-Nets-STILL-Ignoring-Univision-Fast-Furious-Blockbuster","","Big Three Networks Ignore Univision Fast & Furious Special","28","2","0","","2012-10-03 05:38:12","<p><img src=""http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/univision-f-and-f.jpg"" /></p><p>Spanish-language network Univision recently aired a shocking expos&eacute; of the Obama administration's gun running program -- called Fast &amp; Furious -- a policy that has ended up in the murder of hundreds of Mexican citizens. Despite this blockbuster report on Obama's lethal program and new accusations that 16 teenagers were killed by these weapons, neither ABC, CBS, nor NBC have yet said a word during their own news broadcasts about these developments.
</p>
<p>This news blackout is most surprising because the Univision report is so fraught with political repercussions both domestically and in relations between the United States and Mexico. Yet neither of the big three nets seems interested to report on this story.
</p>
<p>The most shocking incident of murder and destruction by narco-terrorists using Obama's guns was the attack on a birthday party attended by dozens of teenagers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 30, 2010, a commando of at least 20 hit men parked themselves outside a birthday party of high school and college students in Villas de Salvarcar, Ciudad Juarez. Near midnight, the assassins, later identified as hired guns for the Mexican cartel La Linea, broke into a one-story house and opened fire on a gathering of nearly 60 teenagers. Outside, lookouts gunned down a screaming neighbor and several students who had managed to escape. Fourteen young men and women were killed, and 12 more were wounded before the hit men finally fled.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>""Indirectly, the United States government played a role in the massacre by supplying some of the firearms used by the cartel murderers,"" Univision concludes.
</p>
<p>ABC's refusal to air any of Univision's report is doubly interesting. This is because ABC has actually <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/fast-furious-scandal-details-emerge-us-government-armed/story?id=17352694#.UGtEAfl27w6"">posted a report</a> on its own website about the Univision expos&eacute;. But despite its online coverage, ABC has ignored the Univision special on its own broadcast news programs.
</p>
<p>The Univision report is in Spanish, but a subtitled version hit the Web Tuesday.

</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning's <em>Good Morning America, </em>the former Clinton Administration staffer&nbsp;sternly warned that if Romney doesn't <em>exceed</em> expectations in the debates, he's finished.
</p>
<p>Why? Because Romney is under ""huge, huge"" pressure, <a href=""http://newsbusters.org/blogs/rich-noyes/2012/10/02/abcs-stephanopoulos-leads-post-debate-media-spin-democrats"">Stephanopoulos says</a>. And ""he's behind right now,"" so if he doesn't <em>over</em>perform, he'll be considered a failure.
</p>
<p>There is always pressure to perform well at debates, granted, but what George Stephanopoulos is trying to do here is set up  expectations of a great, sweeping Romney debate victory, one he couldn't possibly live up to. Stephy hopes to damage Romney's performance in the minds of ABC's viewers before he even steps one foot on the stage Wednesday.
</p>
<p>But this is par for the course for George Stephanopoulos. He's spent the last 12 years trying to pump up Democrat presidential debate performances. The Media Research Center put together a great montage of Stephy news clips from the past three presidential debates, all of which show him effusively praising the performance of the Democrat candidates.</p>

<p>Drudge previewed the tape's unveiling at 3:03 PM EST on Twitter Tuesday:</p>
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet tw-align-center"">
<p>Curious tape dropping tonight. NOT from MOTHERJONES. Will cause controversy,ignite accusations of racism -- in both directions!</p>
&mdash; MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) <a href=""https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/253208624489459713"">October 2, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the popular news website has leaked further details. The tape is in the possession of the Daily Caller, features the then-Senator giving a warm adulation to controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, and features divisive statements about inner cities vs. suburbs and the needs of the poor. The portion of the speech relating to Rev. Wright was <a href=""http://newsbusters.org/blogs/warner-todd-huston/2008/03/16/contrary-claims-obama-very-close-racist-preacher-wright"">previously covered</a> by Breitbart News's Warner Todd Huston in 2008.</p>
<p>A description from the Daily Caller reads, ""For nearly 40 minutes, using an accent he never adopts in public, Obama describes a racist, zero-sum society, in which the white majority profits by exploiting black America.""</p>
<p>The tape would not be aired or posted online until 9PM EST on Sean Hannity's Fox News program and on the Daily Caller website, but progressive journalists quickly began searching for the promised video.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed Politics posted several edited clips from the speech, apparently delivered at Hampton University in June of 2007. Others found a transcript of Obama's prepared statements. These sources did not contain all of the quotes teased by Drudge, which suggest the remarks were off the cuff.</p>
<p>Several progressive journalists have <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/Halperin-Seethes-at-Drudge-Over-Obama-Vid"">reacted</a> to the video's social media buzz <a href=""https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/253263366599106560"">angrily</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/status/253261939663335425"">dismissively</a> before learning the contents of the full 40-minute speech.</p>
<p>UPDATE: In the <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/02/obama-speech-jeremiah-wright-new-orleans"">now-released video</a>, Obama goes off his script, which calls for racial and religious unity, and condemns the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina. Senator Obama proclaims that the government neglected to waive the Stafford Act, requiring hurricane victims to contribute 10% of each dollar spent by the federal government on cleanup efforts. In contrast, officials waived this provision of the Stafford Act for 9/11 and Hurricane Andrew. Obama insinuates that the waiver happened because, unlike predominantly black New Orleans, the government considers New Yorkers and Floridians ""part of the American family.""</p>
<p>Discussing the poor in America, Obama stated:&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expect them to have all the skills they need to work. They may need help with basic skills, how to shop, how to show up for work on time, how to wear the right clothes, how to act appropriately in an office. We have to help them get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daily Caller editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson <a href=""http://cms.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/02/Tucker-On-Obama-Speech-Not-Dog-Whistle-Dog-Siren"">tore into</a> the content of the speech in a ""Hannity"" interview after the controversial clips first aired on television. He described Obama's affected dialect as ""phony,"" challenged the truthfulness of Obama's Katrina aid account, and described the tenor of his speech as ""not a dog whistle"" but a ""dog siren.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlson and co-author Vince Coglianese note that reporters were present for Obama's speech in 2007 but none of the racially charged quotes made it into print or video coverage of the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left-wing pundits and reporters alternatively attacked and downplayed the video. On the ""Hannity"" broadcast, commentator Juan Williams claimed the release of the tape was ""<a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/02/Wiliams-Accuses-Hannity-of-Playing-Race-Card-on-Obama-Speech-Video"">playing the race card</a>"" against Obama.</p>
<p>Politico depicted the video as old news:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>Wright, Obama said, is &ldquo;my pastor, the guy who puts up with me, counsels me, listens to my wife complain about me. He&rsquo;s a friend and a great leader. Not just in Chicago, but all across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0.9em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #ffffff;"">But as with other parts of the tape, that quote is not new &mdash; Obama&rsquo;s ad-libbed shout out made it to No. 3 on a POLITICO list of the top gaffes of the 2008 campaign.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0.9em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #ffffff;"">During the 2008 campaign, Obama made clear that he felt the federal government had let down the predominantly minority victims of Hurricane Katrina &ndash; so those sentiments also are not new. But Obama&rsquo;s words in the video come across as much more raw and more visceral than his usual carefully measured words about race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0.9em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #ffffff;"">On the second page of the Politico story, author Jennifer Epstein admits portions of the speech are ""newly unearthed.""</p>
<p>CNN's Howard Kurtz dismissed the Daily Caller's indictment of the media because, like today, no progressive reporters found the remarks <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/02/conservative-outlets-push-old-video-of-barack-obama-talking-about-the-poor.html"">newsworthy in 2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>An analysis of why some blacks are angry and frustrated is not the same as racial rabble-rousing, which explains why the speech drew little coverage at the time, when Obama had been a presidential candidate for nearly six months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 17th, journalists pursued presidential candidate Mitt Romney for comment on an incomplete video of remarks about the poor released by a left-wing magazine. Romney held a press conference the same evening as the tape segment's release. The press has not similarly pushed the Obama campaign for clarification of Obama's belief that the poor ""need help with basic skills.""</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/8ljwyVfYYoc"" width=""1"" />"

And more importantly, something that might derail all the wicked work he's done to drag a failed president over the reelection finish line. </p>
<p>Mark Halperin one of the leaders of what he calls ""The Gang of 500"" -- or those who control the media.&nbsp;He's the guy who yucks it up with Joe Scarborough every morning and who sits on political stories so he can later release them in books like ""Game Change"" that trash Republicans with legions of unnamed sources. </p>
<p>Halperin is as elite a mainstream media puppet master as there is; a narrative creator and driver that many minions in the media look to for the nod that okays this or that.&nbsp;And naturally, that nod almost always has to do with stories damaging to Republicans and/or helpful to Democrats. </p>
<p>But today Matt Drudge made Mark Halperin mad. Oh, so very, very mad. So mad, in fact, that Halperin is already raging on Twitter about how a story he hasn't seen is a ""freak show.""</p>
<p>You see, Matt Drudge stopped the world today without Mark Halperin's permission; Drudge launched a siren to tease out&nbsp;a video airing on Fox News tonight that&nbsp;might be damaging to Obama -- but&nbsp;if you're Mark Halperin that's the commission of an unpardonable sin on two levels:&nbsp;First off, only Mark Halperin's&nbsp;""Gang of 500"" is supposed to stop the world and control the narrative. Secondly, Halperin has already declared his precious Barack Obama the winner of this campaign -- so there will be no ""October Surprises."" </p>
<p>Now, you would think a self-described newsman and political junkie would be excited over this. After all, The Narrative about Romney losing the election and all the pre-game debate stuff is boring. Also, as a journalist, you would think new information about a sitting president would be exciting!</p>
<p>But the same Mark Halperin who helped drive&nbsp; Romney's ""47 percent video"" into the ground isn't happy at all about this video. In fact, he's furious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moderators help set the outcome for Democrats in three ways: by framing the questions against Republican candidates; by letting Democrats break the rules on time and rebuttals; and by favoring Democrats in post-debate analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best move in response? Mock the moderator.</p>
<p>
It worked for Sen. Scott Brown in 2010, when moderator David Gergen challenged him: &ldquo;Are you willing... to say, I&rsquo;m going to be the person, I&rsquo;m going to sit in Teddy Kennedy&rsquo;s seat and I&rsquo;m going to be the person that&rsquo;s gonna block [health reform] for another fifteen years?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown&rsquo;s aggressive response won him the election:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, with all due respect, it&rsquo;s not the Kennedy seat, and it&rsquo;s not the Democrats&rsquo; seat. It&rsquo;s the people&rsquo;s seat.&rdquo;</p>
<center></center>
<p>
It also worked for Newt Gingrich in the Republican primaries, helping him surge to a win in South Carolina after putting CNN&rsquo;s John King in his place for asking about his ex-wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to take some time to respond to that?&rdquo; King asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gingrich, &ldquo;but I will... I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate with a topic like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The media hated it--and the audience loved it, giving Newt a standing ovation.</p>
<p>
As the Brown case illustrates, it&rsquo;s not just conservatives that love a good shot or two at the moderators--it&rsquo;s everybody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Democrats trust the mainstream media more than most, dislike of journalists and the media in general is widespread. It is the basis of Jon Stewart&rsquo;s entire comedy routine on ""The Daily Show""--which is where, we are told, Generation Y and the Obama-loving millenials get most of their primary information.</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a fine art to taking down the corrupt ref, and Sarah Palin played her hand a little too openly, giving disappointed liberals something to criticize after she beat Joe Biden soundly in the 2008 Vice Presidential debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telling PBS&rsquo; Gwen Ifill--who already had a book on Obama in the works, and went on to mock Palin&rsquo;s (superior) knowledge of the Boston Tea Party--that she &ldquo;may not answer the questions&rdquo; was Palin&rsquo;s only misstep.</p>
<p>
For the first presidential debate in Denver, the moderator will be Ifill&rsquo;s colleague at PBS, Jim Lehrer, who has a long history of helping Democrats in the debates and denied in 2008 what virtually everyone now admits--that the media was &ldquo;in the tank&rdquo; for Obama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is virtually guaranteed that Lehrer&rsquo;s questions will tend to put Romney firmly on the defensive, while setting Obama up for long monologues and filibuster-style evasions.&nbsp;But that also presents Romney with choice opportunities--and he must seize them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To attack the moderator is to speak directly to the American people, past the self-appointed liberal gatekeepers, and beyond the control of the comfortable incumbent who only has to beat the spread to satisfy the commentariat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, it&rsquo;s a tactic Obama can&rsquo;t use to the same effect: it would look petty, given that the media are in his corner already.</p>
<p>
Republicans--Romney included--have repeatedly made the mistake of allowing their political fates to be decided in debates run by the same people that devote the rest of their days and nights to destroying conservatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet there are some advantages to be found, even on an uneven playing field. If Romney can push back, at the right moment and with the necessary wit, he will defeat the moderator--and his other opponent, too.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/m9zSzbE4Ji8"" width=""1"" />"

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We all knew the media would protect Obama at all costs by distracting from the economy and attacking Romney over his wealth. That stuff wasn't hard to predict. It was the Obama game-plan, which meant it would be the media's as well. But the fun part of the discussion was in <em>imagining the possibilities.&nbsp; </em>How low would they go? How desperate would they act? How shameless? How brazen? How stupid? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We batted around every possible idea including the absurd, safe in the knowledge that when you&rsquo;re talking about the most corrupt institution allowed to operate legally in America, absurdities really aren't. But never in a million years would any of us have expected Politico to do what it did today. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The Middle East is burning; the White House is engaged in a cover up; the FBI cannot gain access to the scene of an ambassador's assassination at the hands of al-Qaeda; we learned today that security in Benghazi was not only lax but that requests for increased security were ignored; our GDP was just downgraded to 1.3%; orders for durable goods collapsed 12%; and poverty is on the march. </p>

But does the hyper focus of this fact, highlighted by a new video released from the Democratic National Committee shed too much light on the tactics of the government media to derail Mitt Romney&rsquo;s campaign?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DNC&rsquo;s choice to isolate sound bytes and news clips emphasizing the importance of Mitt Romney&rsquo;s performance this week as a make or break moment for his campaign sets the stage for a well crafted media narrative that we can all expect to see upon the slightest mistake or weakness that they can pin on Mitt Romney and use it as a tool to blow up in epic proportions against him.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking back at <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6043394#.UGnLc7SpW4R"">George Stephanopoulos&rsquo; commentary</a> after the final 2008 debate between candidates Obama and McCain provides insight towards what we can expect to see from the government media this time around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Obama did not get ruffled. He handled McCain's attacks extremely well. He was cool, he remained calm, and he did a good job of explained [sic] his positions&hellip;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">In terms of style, Obama won the battle of the televised split screens. McCain had several reaction shots during the debate where he rolled his eyes, seemed exasperated with Obama, and on the edge of anger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">On the other hand, Obama remained cool under pressure, smiling through the attacks. That's the demeanor Obama's had throughout the three debates that has served him well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Ultimately, McCain didn't do enough to stop people from voting for Obama. Over the course of three debate [sic] the Obama campaign met their goal of reassuring the American people that he's ready to serve as president.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stephanopoulos&nbsp;continued by emphasizing the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; victory for Obama in that and both prior debates was &ldquo;staying cool under pressure,&rdquo; not for his ability to present winning solutions to the American people about problems facing our country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DNC&rsquo;s new video also gives rise to the question: If the government media are not working with a narrative to reelect President, wouldn't it be not worth highlighting that this is most likely the biggest moment in his political career as well? After a tremendous victory in 2008, his first four years in office have proved that he was all talk. George Stephanopoulos was right, President Obama won because &ldquo;he was cool,&rdquo; not because of his ideas, and this debate would be just as much a make or break moment in the President&rsquo;s political career if they only treated it as such.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/b45xndYR5uY"" width=""1"" />"

<br />
One of the most reliable pro-Democratic pundits is none other than George Stephanpoulos &mdash; not especially surprising, given his track record as a loyal operative for Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 1992 presidential campaign, but hardly the objective, <strong><a href=""http://www.mrc.org/node/32823#4"">unbiased voice touted by ABC News</a></strong>.

</blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">Basically, what's happening here is that&nbsp;recently-released juiced polls with wild skews in favor of Democrat turnout still show the race closing. But since The Narrative to disqualify Mitt Romney must remain: <em>Romney can do nothing right and Obama can do nothing wrong --</em> a Romney comeback narrative is absolutely out of the question.&nbsp;Therefore, the media needs something to distract attention from these inconvenient polls. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">So, yesterday, the <em>Washington Post</em> cooked up a phony swing state poll so the media could talk about how Romney's losing by double digits in the swing states instead of how he's closing the race nationally.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">Today, it's Quinnipiac's turn to give the media a narrative to push that distracts from the race closing, and that's with yet another -- as Flynn points out -- ""meaningless statistics within their poll to boost"" Obama -- this time <a href=""http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1801"">the gender gap</a>:</p>

And this is a purely political and partisan choice the media's making &hellip; and a dangerous one. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">As we've seen with Mitt Romney, when properly motivated, the media can exact a heavy price from a politician over a sin found unpardonable. We saw this with Romney's taxes, Clint Eastwood's chair, Romney's statement the day after the Libya attack, the ""47 percent video"" and even swing state polls that show Romney behind. What the media's done with each of these stories is come together as one to use them as bludgeons to beat Romney senseless. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This, however, is not happening over a story the media should be outraged over -- &nbsp;the Libya cover up. Yes, the media's dutifully reporting on the story, and as you'll see below with CNN's Erin Burnett, even using the term ""cover up."" But as of now, there's been no bruising narrative, no call for the White House to come clean, and no demand for Obama to call a press conference and answer questions. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">--</p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">---</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">What the White House hit us with wasn't just spin either. In that clip, CNN's own foreign affairs correspondent reports that her sources told her within 24 hours that Benghazi was a terror attack. So she knows what the White House knew and therefore knew that the narrative spun out of the White House for eight days was a bald-faced lie. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Moreover, CNN isn't the only outlet with knowledge that the White House knew within 24 hours that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Numerous outlets -- not just Fox News -- reported within 24 hours that terrorists were behind the attack. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And yet, this very same media apparently had no problem being lied to for a week and still has no problem with it. Worse, even as the media reports on the Libya cover up, they obviously have no intention to hold anyone accountable for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And these were <strong>lies</strong> coming from the White House; not spin -- lies. Five days after the attack, when U.N.

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">CARNEY: All I can tell you is that based on the information that we had then and have now we do not yet have indication that it was pre-planned or pre-meditated.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: center;"">---</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">These are not examples of spin or half-truths or even little white lies; these are outright lies -- concrete examples of the two high-placed administration officials speaking on behalf of a White House that knew what we were being told was not true. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Three, five, and eight days later, the White House was declaratively stating there was <strong>no</strong> intelligence stating that what happened in Benghazi was anything other than a spontaneous protest gone bad. Now we know the White House most certainly had intelligence stating Benghazi was terrorism. In fact, it now looks as though that was <strong>the only</strong> intelligence the White House had. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For just a moment, let's forget politics; let's forget about the election and let's forget Republican vs. Democrat. Instead, let's talk about what's healthy for our democracy. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">During the Bush administration, the media was most certainly biased and most certainly over-hyped any little thing they felt might hurt Bush -- no question about it. But during the Bush-era, I was at least able to relax, safe in the knowledge that the White House was being closely watched and scrutinized. There was a very real and healthy benefit found in the media's zeal to bring Bush down. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But the message the media is sending now is just the opposite: The media's telling powerful Democrats, including a sitting president, that when politics are on the line, you can pretty much do whatever you please. Lie to us, betray us, and then cover it all up -- no problem, because we want to get you over the finish line. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This isn't media bias; it's something much more sinister. It's being accessories after-the-fact &ndash;&nbsp;willing co-conspirators in a cover up. And the message it sends is what's most troubling, because if the powerful in either party can ever count on the fact -- that for whatever reason -- the watchdogs are willing to look away, there's no telling where it might lead. &nbsp;</p>

That man is TRN's Jerry Doyle.
</p>
<p>Noting that the network ""owns no stations"" and that its stable of hosts have to ""earn their keep "" by garnering syndicated affiliates, TRN promises radio stations that Doyle will be ""eminently saleable.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today begins the first in a series of changes to bring talk radio firmly into the 21st century. For too long, we&rsquo;ve had to choose between ratings and salability, but no longer. Today the 6th largest syndicated talk show in America replaces what was the 3rd largest show, and in so doing, stations will get more light and less heat, a show that they can sell locally with pride, but also a show that will respect its stations, advertisers and audiences with a brilliance that sets great shows apart from good ones.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doyle will debut on nearly 300 stations, a bit fewer than Savage as some stations have already made their own changes since Savage left the airwaves last month.
</p>
<p>Doyle, a former actor who for five seasons starting in 1994 had a recurring role on the hit science fiction TV series&nbsp;<em>Babylon 5</em>, broadcasts from Las Vegas, Nevada and has been a talk show host since 2000 after a losing bid for Congress in California.
</p>
<p>Savage, whose real name is Michael Weiner, <a href=""http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_21653093/michael-savage-leaves-radio-show-after-legal-win"">walked off his show</a> on September 28 after winning a court battle over a contract dispute with TRN. His lawyer told the media that Savage conducted a two-year battle to get out of a 10-year-old contract with the network. Savage complained that his contract precluded him from entering into talks with competing employers and essentially indentured him to TRN for life. After winning the case, Savage left TRN and his former show behind. He reports that he's in already in talks with networks to pick up a new program he plans to launch.
</p>
<p>Savage's show was heard on nearly 400 stations nationwide and according to Talkers Magazine, a talk radio trade publication, had an audience of <a href=""http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/"">8.75 million listeners</a>. In the 2012 <em><a href=""http://www.talkers.com/heavy-hundred/"">Talkers Heavy Hundred</a></em> ratings he was the third most popular talk show host. On that same list, Savage's replacement, <a href=""http://www.talkers.com/heavy-hundred/second/"">Jerry Doyle, appears in the 16th slot</a>.

<p>Nate Silver, gatekeeper of polls for the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, called the attempt to debate polling data an episode of &ldquo;attacking the messenger.&rdquo; A headline under a photo of two Obama yard signs states: &ldquo;The 2008 race was a good one for polls: they got Barack Obama&rsquo;s margin of victory exactly right.&rdquo; A big self-congratulatory pat on the back for the mainstream media! </p>
<p>Silver then wastes his time by doing a history of all of final polls before elections and how they closely mirror the end result. Of course, we aren&rsquo;t debating the final polls. It's obvious pollsters will attempt to get the number right when their credibility is on the line. We are debating polls that happen <em>before </em>the final poll. Right now, these polls drive narratives like &ldquo;Romney is losing!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wow, women sure love Obama!&rdquo; and fill newspaper headlines for weeks. So a history lesson on the polls no one is complaining about misses the point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If Silver had decided to look at what polls from <em>NYT</em> and CBS were saying before their final poll in 2008, he would see that they had Obama winning by 14 early in October. That number would then drop to 13 in mid-October, and then 11 by the end of the month. The final CBS poll would settle in at 9 points, two points higher than Obama&rsquo;s final margin of victory. So yes, the &ldquo;final&rdquo; poll was within 2 points of getting the vote right. But the one taken less than 4 weeks earlier had estimated his lead by more than double what actually happened. I'm guessing Nate Silver would have a great explanation about the McCain surge no one else experienced. </p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times </em>(in conjunction with the CBS News and Quinnipiac University) have easily provided the <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/26/Media-Malpractice-NYT-Poll-Pushes-Absurd-Democratic-Turnout-Model"">worst polling samples</a> of the cycle, showing Democratic turnout at unprecedented levels in states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>But he is not alone. Chris Cillizza over at the<em>&nbsp;Washington Post</em> asks and answers: &ldquo;Does the &lsquo;skewed polls&rsquo; crowd have a point? Not really.&rdquo; Between two posts, he goes into a lengthy discussion as to why large over-sampling of Democrats is perfectly fine. Mostly, he says it is acceptable because according to Pew Research there are simply more Democrats in the country, and there always have been. That point is not in disagreement, but it is also well known that a large portion of self-described Democrats simply never vote. Typically, that's why some might look at exit poll data from prior years to see who actually turns out. </p>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>Cillizza argues that exit polling data is pointless. Yes, actual data from prior elections should not be used when analyzing polls. He says that &ldquo;perhaps most importantly, remember that the exit poll captures the composition of the last electorate &mdash; not the composition of the next electorate.&rdquo; He uses this excuse to avoid having to debate the main argument of poll critics: that the polls &ndash; chiefly those by <em>WaPo</em> and <em>NYT</em> &ndash; have far greater Democrats turning out than have ever turned out before. But hey, if Pew says so...</p>
<p>Cillizza declared Pew Research the &ldquo;gold-standard in non-partisan polling&rdquo; and said that the <em>WaPo</em> samples are correct because Pew's non-voting adult samples back up the argument. How good is Pew? In their final poll in 2008, Pew Research just about nailed the 2008 result when they predicted a 6 point win for Obama. But what&rsquo;s even more astonishing is that just a week before the election, on October 26th, the Pew poll had Obama up on McCain by an amazing 15 points. So in one week, McCain went from trailing Obama by 15 points to just 6 by election day. That was one heck of a surge for McCain at a time he was getting hammered and it was clearly over. But hey, Pew &ldquo;nailed it."" Or, perhaps, the last poll got a little extra tweaking so they wouldn't be embarrassed. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Almost all of the polls in 2008 showed Obama with a healthy lead for the final 6 weeks of the campaign, but the internal polling data made sense. This is why nobody was complaining about polls then. Against McCain, polls had Obama winning independents nationally and in just about every state by a healthy margin. Enthusiasm was sky-high among Democrats and below break-even with Republican voters. Obama was popular, and his favorability was in the 60-70% range by election day. First-time voter excitement was at levels never before seen. Every data point was pointing to an easy Obama win over McCain.</p>
<p>But the data is different this year. Polls show Romney has been <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/09/27/Romney-Winning-Swing-State-Independents-Media-Ignores"">winning independents</a> in key states. <em>USA Today</em>/Gallup <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/09/29/poll-obama-romney-gallup/1601125/"">showed</a> a complete reversal in enthusiasm from 2008, and Republicans now have a 16-point edge. And while Romney might not have Obama&rsquo;s 2008 favorability numbers, neither does Obama. Even there, Obama has dipped to break-even and not much better than Romney's, whose favorability numbers have been steadily climbing. And when it comes to job approval and handling of the economy, Obama is hanging in the 40s. Unlike 2008, the polling data just doesn't mesh with media's published declarations of Obama dominance. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is a good shot that we will see a &ldquo;Romney surge&rdquo; from these pollsters as November 6 approaches. It&rsquo;s also a good bet that most of the pollsters will get the winner right -- even if it is Romney -- on their final poll. But it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that many of their current polls are loaded with scenarios that are almost impossible in the present political climate. But at least they know we are watching now.</p>

<p>That's right, Gov. Romney is wasting his time campaigning and the citizens who support him are wasting their time too. In fact, conservatives and moderates, Republicans and Democrats, and the mass of independents who've planned to vote for Romney might as well just stay at home, because ""Obama wins.""</p>
<p>Congressman Paul Ryan need not continue pointing out the dismal state of Obama's foreign policy and Rush Limbaugh need no longer say Obama's economic policies are damaging this country. It's all for naught, because ""Obama wins.""</p>
<p>On what basis does the AP say this? On <a href=""http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2012/10/01/20121001obama-romney-election-standing.html"">the basis</a> of ""polls which show the president with a steady lead over Romney,"" of course. The problem is that some such polls, like the Washington Post-ABC poll, only surveyed <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/the-polls-show-a-race-that-is-still-up-for-grabs/2012/10/01/57b1d8a2-0be1-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html"">160 people</a>, and even then were only able to show an 11-point lead for Obama in a poll that has an 8-point margin of error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, his lead could be 3 points, and depending on how the poll is weighted internally, it could be nothing. And given the press's unrealistic partisan weighting of respondents, it's questionable whether he leads at all.</p>
<p>Just in case Romney supporters are smart enough to ignore the polls and show up to vote en masse on election day, the AP has covered its tracks by saying its ""analysis isn't meant to be predictive.""</p>

A v</span>ideo of Caddell&rsquo;s remarks were posted this weekend and has since gone viral.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""The press&rsquo;s job is to stand in the ramparts and protect the liberty and freedom of all of us from a government and from organized governmental power,"" Caddell proclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The critical passage of the speech reads:</span></p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When they desert those ramparts and decide that they will now become active participants, that their job is not simply to tell you who you may vote for, and who you may not, but, worse&mdash;and this is the danger of the last two weeks&mdash;what truth that you may know, as an American, and what truth you are not allowed to know, they have, then, made themselves a fundamental threat to the democracy, and, in my opinion, made themselves the enemy of the American people.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh praised Caddell&rsquo;s elocution on Monday.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;Caddell&rsquo;s right!,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;You can't bring yourselves to report the truth about this until the story is over, when it no longer matters.&nbsp; But for the five or six days that matter right after the story, you carry the regime's water.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell said Libya should have &ldquo;should have been the equivalent, for Barack Obama, of George Bush&rsquo;s &lsquo;flying over Katrina&rsquo; moment. But nothing was said at all, and nothing will be said.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">He expounded further:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p class=""p2"">If a President of either party&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care whether it was Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or George Bush or Ronald Reagan or George H. W. Bush&mdash;had a terrorist incident, and got on an airplane after saying something, and flown off to a fundraiser in Las Vegas, they would have been crucified!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell said the mainstream media &ldquo;crossed some lines&rdquo; in their coverage of Libya, and it was a &ldquo;frightening&rdquo; thing to him.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Caddell also accused the mainstream media of using polls they know are inaccurate as weapons against Republicans. He referenced polls whose samples predict Democrats will have a greater turnout in 2012 than in 2008 even as journalists write story after story about how nearly every part of the Obama coalition is less enthusiastic about him than they were in 2008.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">&ldquo;When I have polls that have the preference of Democrats over Republicans higher than it was in 2008, which was a peak Democratic year, I know I am dealing with a poll that shouldn&rsquo;t be reported,&rdquo; Caddell said. &ldquo;And yet they are being done, and they are being done with that knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">In an optimistic turn, Caddell declared the rise of new media made it easier to fight back against the mainstream media, and the old argument of &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t get in a pissing match with someone who buys ink by the barrel&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply in the new media era.<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">&ldquo;There are too many outlets, too many ways to do it, and the country doesn&rsquo;t have the confidence in the press that they once had,&rdquo; Caddell said, referencing a recent Gallup poll that found 60% of Americans distrust the mainstream media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell emphasized that mainstream journalists have thin skins, and they &ldquo;wilt&rdquo; when challenged. That is why, he explained, &ldquo;they need to be called out&rdquo; and &ldquo;their organizations need to be called out.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;The fact is, if I were out there, if I were doing one of these campaigns, I wouldn&rsquo;t let one of these guys by with anything,&rdquo; Caddell said. &ldquo;They have now made the decision they will control the political process. &nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">""They are serving&mdash;with the hundreds of millions of dollars that the networks and these newspapers are, in effect, contributing&mdash;in-kind contributions to candidates in the Democratic Party. That&rsquo;s the legal issue that I would have been exploring. I mean, I would begin to put the heat on.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">However, said, members of the Republican establishment do not say anything because &ldquo;too many reporters, too many political people in the Republican party in this town want to maintain their relationships with the press.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;The corruption in this town is so great. Everybody in Washington seems to almost be on the take&mdash;with the exception of everybody in this room, and the assistants here. Everybody&rsquo;s on the take here, and everybody&rsquo;s cutting up their stock,&rdquo; Caddell lamented. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, what used to be one of the best and most important things for the press, which was the investigative journalism of corruption and money, the stealing of the taxpayers, the looting of the Treasury, isn&rsquo;t an issue, and why no one speaks of it in this town.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re at the most dangerous time in our political history in terms of the balance of power in the role that the media plays in whether or not we maintain a free democracy or not,&rdquo; Caddell said.<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell listed off some examples of mainstream media malpractice during his speech. He wondered how the press could not ask how Valerie Jarrett could have a Secret Service detail and better security than Ambassador Chris Stevens. He wondered how Sunday talk show hosts would not ask David Plouffe, Obama&rsquo;s former campaign manager, about the $100,000 in speaking fees he received from an Iranian front group in Nigeria. He asked why the press would not look into Peter Schweizer&rsquo;s Government Accountability Institute study that documented the corruption behind many of Obama&rsquo;s green energy boondoggles.&nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;Of course Republicans don&rsquo;t raise it because in Washington, they simply want to do it when they get back in power,&rdquo; Caddell said. &ldquo;And, of course, the press doesn&rsquo;t because they basically have taken themselves out of doing their job.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell went on Fox News on Monday and defended his remarks. He asserted the mainstream media helps Obama through omissions as well, by not reporting on stories about how the Obama administration is trying to suppress military absentee votes and bully defense contractors into not sending layoff notices that are required by law or laying off employees. Caddell said these omissions amounted to ""corruption of the first order.""&nbsp;</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/255bQkL-kKw"" width=""1"" />"

<p>But the corrupt media will report&nbsp;as gospel poll numbers based on a partisan advantage no one believes reflects what will happen on election day. But those of us who question poll numbers based on a turnout advantage no one thinks will occur are the crazy ones. The sane ones&nbsp;question NOTHING. </p>

"508","http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BigJournalism/~3/gsU1prk8Cpg/Media-Watch-WaPo-Bogus-Poll","","Media Watch: WaPo Swing State Poll Is Utter Garbage","28","2","0","","2012-10-01 19:58:00","<p>All day long the media has used a juiced <em>Washington Post</em> swing-state poll showing Romney down 52 - 41 as a bludgeon to further an unrelenting narrative that the race is over and Romney supporters are nothing more than fools wasting their time if they come out to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, even though the poll made no sense when you looked at the same poll showing Obama only up by two nationally, 49&nbsp;- 47.</p>
<p>But when it comes to The Narrative, though, corrupt media types like the <em>Washington Post </em>and Chuck Todd and their ilk, never once pause to wonder if something might be off about a poll like this -- even though it's obvious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But scrutiny and curiosity are not part of the&nbsp;media's job anymore. Today it's all about The Narrative and if The Narrative says Romney's losing, you must be a slave to The Narrative and never question that which contradict The Narrative -- even a poll as ludicrous and nonsensical as this one. </p>
<p>Thanks to some actual journalism, we have now learned that this ridiculous swing state poll reported as gospel all day is in fact <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/the-polls-show-a-race-that-is-still-up-for-grabs/2012/10/01/57b1d8a2-0be1-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html"">total and complete garbage</a>:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>As I learned from Post pollster Jon Cohen, that finding is based on the responses of a total of 160 people, and it has a margin of error of 8 percentage points. So yes, there <i>may</i> be a difference between swing-state and national numbers, but the gap might be very small or it might be big.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it's too late, isn't it? The damage has already been done. The message to start the week has already gone out. </p>
<p>Rather than focus on a number of national polls that show the race tightening, the corrupt media instead ran with this one to&nbsp;push the Romney-losing narrative. </p>
<p>The most revealing thing is that everyone knew this poll was junk; including the Chuck Todds of the world. But that doesn't matter -- what they know and what makes logical sense, doesn't matter. </p>
<p>What matters is that the poll fit The Narrative and could be weaponized against Romney. </p>

It's also owned by<em>The Washington Post</em>. </p>
<p>Saturday, The Root published an entire article devoted to this headline: <a href=""http://www.theroot.com/blogs/racism-election-2012/will-romney-reach-out-racists-debates""><em>Will Romney Reach out to Racists in Debates?</em></a></p>
<p>The subtext of the article is&nbsp;even more noxious; that if Romney does win it will be due to racism:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>Now the Romney campaign finds itself at a crossroads. With just over a month to go before the election, the question becomes: Will he be willing to do what McCain wasn't, in order to win at any cost? Will he give in to the temptation and begin lacing his ads and language with messages to appeal to those who miss the days of the Southern strategy -- and the days of a white Republican president? </p>
<p>We've already seen him begin flirting with the racially inflammatory line by making a joke about his birth certificate that many saw as a reference to the manufactured controversy surrounding the president's birth. Romney's language in the debates will confirm whether or not he is willing to cross that line in the quest for victory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the fact that the <em>Washington Post</em> owns a publication that would engage in that kind of Racial McCarthyism isn't troubling enough, a source tells me that on Saturday, The Root story appeared prominently on <em>Washington Post's</em> home page under top headlines -- with an even worse headline:</p>

Her effort can only be described as revolting, as she attempted to apply lace to the disgusting dress of evangelic-infanticide while also managing to reinforce other dominant and false left-of-center narratives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goldberg interviews a doctor who heads a Dutch ""effort to bring safe abortions"" to nations where the practice is outlawed. The pro-abortion Dutch group behind the effort is named ""Women on Waves,"" and they set out via ship to provide what they call the ""fundamental human right of autonomy and sexual freedom.""
The group's founder, Dutch gynecologist Rebecca Gomberts, says her effort was inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Though Goldberg does make brief mention of the fact the Dutch government has previously declared Gomberts' efforts as ""lacking of appropriate medical training,"" her piece glances over this shortcoming by surrounding it with deifying statements about the article's subject.
Goldberg adds insult to injury by throwing left-of-center reframing efforts into the mix. For instance, her assertion that ""Islamic law isn't as militantly anti-abortion as Catholic doctrine"" lends to the mainstream media's efforts to frame the over-abundance of militancy of many Islamists as somehow comparable to the isolated incidents of Christians engaging in militant behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After making the assertion that Catholic doctrine is more militant than Islamic doctrine, Goldberg then mentions the death threats and dangers Islamists pose to Women on Waves -- seemingly hoping Daily Beast readers don't realize such details reveal the inaccuracy of her assertion.

She doesn&rsquo;t report that Mr. Ryan loaned his budget committee staff director to Mr. Hensarling on the super committee.

<p>In a dishonest and misleading attempt to defend&nbsp;yet another one of his&nbsp;unrelenting, arrogant, smug, anti-Romney attacks -- but one that blew up in his face over the weekend&nbsp;-- Scarborough claimed this morning that&nbsp;MSNBC did not doctor audio to make it&nbsp;sound as though a crowd chanting ""Romney"" was chanting ""Ryan."" And what Scarborough committed in doing so was a&nbsp;lie of omission.</p>
<p>What Scarborough&nbsp;was referencing was a clip&nbsp;MSNBC broadcast all of last week that&nbsp;made it look as though&nbsp;an arrogant, hapless, and insecure Mitt Romney attempted to change a ""Ryan"" chant at a campaign rally&nbsp;into a chant that that included his name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the media loves to use willing Republicans to undermine Romney, Scarborough's reaction to the clip got the most media attention. You&nbsp;can watch&nbsp;it <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/09/28/MSNBC-Caught-Doctoring-Clip-From-Romney-Ryan-Rally"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Note: To emphasize&nbsp;the crowd was chanting ""Ryan,"" MSNBC added a subtitle that read: ""Crowd: Ryan!""</p>
<p>A day or two after the clip aired and MSNBC had re-broadcast it endlessly, it was discovered that the crowd was not chanting ""Ryan;"" that in fact the crowd was chanting ""Romney.""&nbsp;Numerous on-the-scene reports filed in real-time reported the crowd chanting ""Romney,"" including the <em>New York Times</em>. </p>
<p>This means two things...</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>1. MSNBC's subtitle was incorrect. </p>
<p>2. The impression that an arrogant, insecure Romney wanted his name added to the crowd's chant is exactly wrong. The truth is that a gracious Romney wanted Ryan's name added to the chant. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you know the facts, watch Scarborough's misleading defense of his and his network's behavior last week:&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<center></center>
<p>Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;Scarborough doesn't address the fact that MSNBC incorrectly added the subtitle,&nbsp;""Crowd: Ryan!""</p>
<p>Moreover, the video Scarborough played of the Romney rally did not include MSNBC's&nbsp;incorrect subtitle from last week, because Scarborough didn't replay the MSNBC clip. Obviously, Scarborough didn't want to address the subtitle, because that would undermine his whole defense, which is based on the fact that MSNBC altered nothing. </p>
<p>Except MSNBC did alter something; they altered the perception of the entire event with an incorrect subtitle. </p>
<p>Apparently Sell-Out Joe's selling out to the corrupt media is so complete he not only reaffirms every anti-Romney lie his NBC Masters manufacture; he's also a part of the media's&nbsp;indefensible memory-holing of inconvenient facts. </p>

In the Norquistian world that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and the 21st Century Republican Party want to create, soup lines like the one where Big Bird stands in tonight's Night Owls banner would be the answer to the social needs of the jobless and the working poor not making enough money to put food on the table. That's not hyperbole. That is exactly where the Ryan tax-and-budget plan Orwellianly called the ""Path to Prosperity"" would ultimately lead.
<p>Not immediately, of course. They're smarter than that. They know they can't dismantle the Great Society and New Deal programs all at once. Any more than they can get rid of all the financial or environmental or health and safety regulations all at once. Instead, they do their shredding piecemeal. But their ultimate goal is to get us back to where we were with income tax rates on the rich and social spending for the rest of us set at the level of 1925. The days before unemployment insurance, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, cash and housing assistance for poor families, Headstart, Pell Grants and food stamps. Days when income and wealth inequality were peaking, union organizing was illegal and the vast majority of workers only dreamed of an eight-hour workday.</p>
<p>For the plutocrats, <em>that</em> was the good old days.</p>
<p>The Ryan plan, the Romney plan, the Republican plan would shred a broad range of programs, the goal being more shredding later. Food stamp funding would, for example, be <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3717"">chopped and capped</a> and turned into a block grant to the states. Their plan wouldn't end the food stamp program?called SNAP in 26 states for the past four years?but would weaken it substantially. That's the case with other parts of the safety net, too. As Grover Norquist understands, bathtub drownings take time.</p>
<p>Now I have to be fair. Mitt Romney says he <em>likes</em> Big Bird. So, surely he doesn't want to actually see him in a soup line. He'd rather see him in a job. A private-sector job. What could a laid-off 43-year-old of dubious ethnicity with a single line on his résumé expect when his severance pay ran out? Maybe he could occasionally get one of those street-corner jobs waggling a sign directing people to a grand opening of condos or a Wal-Mart. Given its part-time, sporadic nature, it's not the kind of job that would make Big Bird eligible for unemployment insurance, but that's a good thing because we wouldn't want him to become government dependent.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney cuts in the dinner line at his own house and finishes eating before those last in the queue even get their food. You'll excuse me if I find the image of him sitting down with his kids or grandkids to watch ""Sesame Street"" just a tad hard to imagine. So, on second thought, his claim to actually like the yellow fellow is probably akin to his other campaign pronouncements, bogus.</p>
<p>What's not bogus is his desire as would-be president to gut government programs?big and small?while initiating yet another round of cutting taxes for corporations and the rich. Then, when the revenue that is supposed to flow from this effort doesn't appear, he (and his successors) can argue the need to cut even deeper into government spending (except the Pentagon) because we ""can't afford it."" Quite the scam. Sadly, there are some Democrats who buy it.</p>
<p>But not ""Big Bird Democrats."" That's the label Kossack <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/comments/1140719/47824518#c4"">Positronicus</a> created Saturday night. Big Bird Democrats get it. We know what Romney, Ryan and the Republicans are up to. We know how screwed up it is when some Democrats choose to ""compromise"" with these guys.</p>
<p>That's how we all wind up in the soup line.</p>

<td>For a candidate whose first foray into elective politics was met with an enviable raft of prominent endorsers (Mitt Romney, former Governor Pete Wilson, and John McCain) and a ton of free media, the past two weeks have been absolutely brutal for California Republican Meg Whitman. The alleged frontrunner for the GOP nomination for Governor in the Golden State, her introduction to the political stage has been pure amateur hour.
<p>It started with a Sacramento Bee investigative story, which outlined an almost comically sparse voting history for the first-time candidate. The same weekend as that revelation became known, Whitman was blasted in a straw poll at the state GOP convention by state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.</p>
<p>Then, last week, Whitman tried to explain her proclivity for electoral absenteeism, and dug herself in deeper, making the rather silly excuse that she was too busy raising a family to register to vote.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">On Wednesday night, Romney debated his formerly conservative self.</div>
</div>
By most accounts, Mitt Romney scored a clear victory over President Obama at the first presidential debate this past Wednesday evening. The jury is <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140038/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Polling-Wrap-Earliest-post-debate-polling-hints-at-minimal-boost-for-Romney?detail=hide"">still out</a> on how much polling bounce, if any, the Republican nominee will gain from his performance: Good debate performances don't necessarily translate to improvements in poll numbers, after all; and while the Romney campaign will certainly enjoy a boost of energy, media fact-checkers were none too pleased with his <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140032/-What-the-real-Romney-plan-would-do-nbsp-to-nbsp-Medicare?detail=hide"">outright mendacity</a> on many issues, while President Obama's campaign is already trying to make up for an uninspired performance by <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140178/-For-those-who-don-t-think-Romney-s-Big-Bird-moment-is-a-major-thing?showAll=yes"">hitting Romney hard</a> on his desire to take Big Bird off the air.
<p>In the context of Mitt Romney's quest for the presidency, however, a debate win is a debate win, no matter what. If Romney had been perceived to have lost on Wednesday night, pundits would have been hammering even more nails into his campaign's coffin. Regardless of whatever fact-checks and recriminations may follow, then, Romney did what he needed to do. But the larger problem for his party and his ideology (or at least, what everyone thought his ideology was) is that his win came at the explicit cost of conservatism.</p>
<p>The past few months of campaigning had left one thing crystal clear: The severely conservative version of Mitt Romney stood very little chance of winning. Before his most recent upgrade, the previous release of Mitt Romney featured a pick of the arch-conservative Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee. His signature economic policy was a $5 trillion tax cut that would somehow pay for itself. He, like his party, had been a crusader against regulation. He famously wrote off 47 percent of the American population as being lazy moochers, and then <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/02/1138751/-Aide-Romney-prepared-to-address-his-47-comment-during-debate-with-100-nonsense&amp;quot"">defended those comments</a>. The severely conservative Romney wanted to repeal Obamacare because it was a massive government intrusion, and if that meant elimination of coverage for pre-existing conditions, well, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/10/1129929/-Behind-all-the-flip-flops-Romney-will-leave-tens-of-millions-without-nbsp-insurance"">too bad</a>.</p>
<p>According to master prognosticator Nate Silver at <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/"">FiveThirtyEight</a>, severely conservative Romney had a roughly 13 percent chance of winning the election as of Wednesday night. So picture this: It's 34 days before the election, and you're Mitt Romney. The poll numbers are looking bleak, and unlike the conservative base, you know they're not skewed. Donors are on the verge of abandoning your race. You have one last best chance to impress the American people and win them over. So what do you do? Why, abandon conservatism, of course.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Not a nice guy</div>
</div>
President Obama is an astute political junkie like any other astute political junkie, except that he is president, which means he is rather busy, and it is therefore possible that he hasn't had the time to pay enough attention to really understand the personality of Mitt Romney. It is possible that he hasn't had the time to pay enough attention to really comprehend just how depraved Mitt Romney is. Almost all politicians lie, and the greater their ambitions, and the higher they climb on the rungs of political hierarchy, the greater are the odds that lying will become taken for granted as but another of their basic political skills. All presidents lies. All presidents have lied. All nominees to be president have lied. This is a given. This is no surprise. But Mitt Romney isn't any ordinary liar.
<p>Four years ago, then-Sen. Obama faced still-Sen. McCain, and of course being a skilled and astute political junkie and politician, Obama understood that McCain would tell an occassional lie. McCain revealed himself as cranky, and at times nasty, but he never was more than a garden-variety Republican liar. Nothing special, in that regard. Mitt Romney is different. Mitt Romney tells lies as naturally as he breathes. His entire <a href=""http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/08/20/13376256-the-post-truth-campaign-continues-apace?lite"">campaign</a> is <a href=""http://romneytheliar.blogspot.com/"">constructed of lies</a>. His entire <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-federal-bailout-that-saved-mitt-romney-20120829"">identity</a> is <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mitt-romney-expensive-olympics-federal-funding"">constructed of lies</a>. Mitt Romney wouldn't find the truth if given a map, a compass, GPS and professional guides, because Mitt Romney isn't even interested in finding the truth.</p>
<p>President Obama's problems in the first debate were twofold, and one was about style and the other substance. On style, the president seemed too passive and reserved, while Romney seemed like he had had an extra couple cups of coffee, which may not be something to which Romney is habituated. He seemed hyped. Like a frenetic gerbil. And while at least some weren't charmed by his <a href=""https://twitter.com/politicoroger/statuses/253673625876582401"">running roughshod</a> over the <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/10/04/jim_lehrer_useless/"">hapless Jim Lehrer</a>, most of the pundits and a good majority of the viewers seem to think he came off as aggressive and passionate.</p>
<p>The second problem for President Obama was that he seemed unprepared to deal with someone as gleefully mendacious as Romney, and if there was one characteristic that best defined Romney's demeanor during the debate, it was his glee.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Yeah, we know you dislike the gays, but let's get specific about how much.</div>
</div>
No questions about gay rights were included in the domestic policy debate Wednesday.
<p>On one level, this is understandable. The choice for those who actually care at all about LGBT equality is clear: Barack Obama. <strong>Full stop.</strong></p>
<p>But on another level, considering the extraordinary progress that has been made of late, the topic of LGBT rights deserves to be examined, precisely because it has been a big part of the story of the last four years.</p>
<p>And voters deserve to know the priorities of these two men who wish to lead the country. Consider how much time Speaker Boehner's Republican House has spent passing bills regulating women's lady parts and micro-managing gay people's lives since midterms. Stacks and stacks of bills, because <a href=""https://www.washingtonblade.com/2012/07/20/house-oks-measure-aiming-to-end-same-sex-weddings-on-military-bases/"">gay people getting married on military bases</a> is the most pressing issue Republicans can think to address today.</p>
<p>Moreover, how the country proceeds in the recognition of marriage rights for LGBT citizens is not some ethereal, academic hypothetical. It's now. It's happening. It is coming squarely down the pike. There are a handful of cases at this very moment being considered by the Supreme Court, and a Constitutional challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act is almost certainly going to be heard in the high court next year.</p>
<p>However the Supreme Court rules, the decision is going to crash into the first year of next administration with the force of a cultural freight train just about June 2013. And whoever is in charge is going to be called upon to react.</p>
<p>This week, Paul Ryan spoke with <a href=""http://www.glaad.org/cap/jim-daly"">virulently homophobic Focus on the Family president Jim Daly</a> and according to <a href=""http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/paul-ryan-promises-focus-family-fight-gay-equality"">Right Wing Watch</a>, ""reassured the anti-gay group that a Romney-Ryan administration will fiercely oppose gay rights.""</p>
<p>There's no debate, LGBT progress will be greatly stymied under President Romney. But preventing progress isn't enough for his base, they ""want their country back"" and not just from the black people, from the rainbow people too. The question is, <strong>how far is Romney willing to go to turn back the clock for gays?</strong> How many of the administrative changes that Obama has implemented will he revoke? And which ones, specifically?</p>
<p>Romney has pretty much promised to undo everything else Obama has accomplished over the last four years. And even people who don't care too much one way or the other about LGBT progress (which might possibly even represent a majority), deserve to know how much time and energy the Romney administration would task to undoing the collective progress. The collateral damage will be their president piddling away his political capital to extend the last throes of the right wing's failing culture war.</p>
<p>LGBT rights is also another area to push Romney to be specific?something he tries desperately to avoid on all topics. In the political discourse the effective result of not asking him to get specific on LGBT policies is Mitt Romney getting a free pass to promise crazy things to crazy people and no one really thinks twice about the crazy implications. Take, for example, his promise to amend the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>After the fold, a host of very specific questions candidate Romney might be asked at the next debate on issues of importance to the LGBT community and their families in 2012.</p>

<p>So how much time was spent discussing it, during the first presidential debate? <a href=""http://profmandia.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/obama-romney-pbs-let-americans-down-big-time/"">None</a>.

<blockquote>GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney?s big rally Monday in Denver turned out thousands of cheering, pumped up fans at the Wings over the Rockies Air and Space Museum ? an event that provided a last very dramatic public stand before Wednesday?s debate at the University of Denver.
<p>There was a ?huh?? moment: country singer Laurie Morgan serenading the crowd with ?Dixie? ? those ?I wish I were in the land of cotton? lyrics not too often heard at modern day presidential campaign events.</p>
</blockquote>
Which is about as cautious and tame a description as is possible. A more honest description would be that the song first attained popularity in blackface minstrelsy. That it was the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy. That it was a favorite among opponents of the 1960s Civil Rights movement. That it is the unofficial theme song of <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/04/08/855319/-By-All-Means-Let-s-Remember-The-Confederacy?detail=hide"">Civil War revisionists</a>.
<p>Romney, of course, neither criticized nor apologized for this outrage. Nor, apparently, did anyone from his campaign. No doubt they will describe Morgan's serenade as but innocent fun. Like Romney's charming <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2012-08-25/opinion/opinion_brazile-romney-birther-line_1_mitt-romney-birther-years-of-tax-returns"">birther joke</a>. The question being what exactly the song ""Dixie"" has to do with Romney, who is not a Southerner, or with Denver or Colorado, which are not in the South. What is the context? What is the rationale? What could it <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/04/16/720849/-They-Hate-Him-Because-He-Is-Black?detail=hide"">possibly be</a>?</p>

<li>Maybe if our television media responsibly reported the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/19/1066069/-A-brief-guide-to-the-scientific-consensus-on-climate-change?detail=hide"">scientific facts</a> rather than <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/04/16/study-climate-coverage-plummets-on-broadcast-ne/184103"">dishonestly playing it</a> as but another open political debate, <a href=""http://www.france24.com/en/20121004-climate-scepticism-highest-us-britain"">this dangerous embarrassment</a> wouldn't be true:<br />

(The dumbest question of the night!) ?Obamacare?? ?Do you guys have a rhetorical disagreement about the impossibly amorphous concept of ?the role of government???? And finally ?how would you fix partisan gridlock??
<p>So! Sorry, immigration, reproductive health, LGBT civil rights, the environment, campaign finance, the drug war, and voting rights: None of you matter as much as Simpson effing Bowles! (But do you begin to understand why Beltway pundit and commentator types loved this debate so much? It hit all their pet topics!) ?Are there too many regulations? is more important than ?do you think we should maybe do anything at all to address catastrophic climate change.? (Not that either candidate wants to talk about that.)</p>

<p>Far from being tamed, parliamentary legitimacy appears only to have emboldened the extremists. In recent weeks racially-motivated attacks have proliferated.

<p>One survey last week showed a near doubling in the number of people voicing ""positive opinions"" about Golden Dawn, up from 12% in May to 22%. The popularity of Nikos Michaloliakos, the party's rabble-rousing leader had shot up by 8 points, much more than any other party leader.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">No Stone Unturned: The Life and Times<br />
of Maggie Kuhn, by Maggie Kuhn</div>
</div>
<em>""Old age is an excellent time for outrage. My goal is to say or do at least one outrageous thing every week""</em> is a quotation often attributed to Maggie Kuhn, the founder of <a href=""http://graypanthers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=17"">The Gray Panthers</a>.
<p>When I got my Medicare card this last August and officially became a senior citizen, I rushed off to begin claiming senor discounts in local stores. I started thinking about how those of us who are older are stereotyped. Old folks get hit with everything but the kitchen sink in negatives. We are castigated for being stuck in a conservative rut, and charged with every ""ism"" in the bigot basket. Old lady and old man jokes abound.</p>
<p>I can remember being afraid to start blogging at age 60 simply because I thought everyone who blogged was young and living in their parents' basements eating Cheetos. How's that for stereotyping? What could I possibly have in common with young bloggers?</p>
<p>I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised to find a lot of us from my generation and older right here at Daily Kos, and a great range of ages at <a href=""http://www.netrootsnation.org/"">Netroots Nation</a>. More of us who have been on the front lines of organizing and fighting for decades are putting our arthritic fingers to the keyboard and sharing our experience and insights with many of you who may be younger, or the age of our grandkids, if we have them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to celebrate us today, and focus on that group we put in the ""elderly or senior"" box in polling data. Starting with the woman who put the term ""ageism"" into our vernacular?Maggie Kuhn.</p>
<p>PBS highlighted her life and the Gray Panther Movement in a documentary now distributed by Women Make Movies called <a href=""http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c609.shtml"">MAGGIE GROWLS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Maggie Kuhn was never afraid to march to her own beat and fight for what she believed. Born in Buffalo in 1905, she was a passionate social activist right from the start. Maggie entered the workplace in 1926, with a job at the YWCA in Cleveland, organizing poor and working women. In 1950, she began a 20-year stint in the Social Education and Action Office of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A. It was a job she adored, one that kept her in the forefront of the social activist movement for decades. When she turned 65 and was forced to give up the career she loved, Maggie decided that she would not fade away quietly. Saying ""don't agonize, organize,"" and reminding them that they had nothing to lose, she galvanized a group of friends and colleagues who had also been put prematurely out to pasture and launched the career for which she is renowned: as founder and leader of the Gray Panthers.
<p>Maggie's second career unfolded in television appearances with Johnny Carson; on Capitol Hill, chiding senators and congressmen; and on the picket line, fighting injustice for all people, wherever she could. She also spoke fondly of her many love affairs and close friendships. Maggie's insistence on talking publicly about sex, which often made her listeners squirm, lead to a serious re-thinking about what growing old was all about. As Maggie said, ""Sex and learning end only when rigor mortis sets in.""</p>
<p>In an era replete with ""movements,"" the media quickly latched onto Maggie. Looking like the stereotypical sweet little old lady, when Maggie spoke, people listened. With a disarming mixture of humor, shock value and common sense, Maggie deftly used her high visibility to combat media stereotypes that denigrated the elderly and went on to champion universal health care, nursing home reform, shared housing and consumer protection. MAGGIE GROWLS looks at the forces that shaped the movement as well as its leader, using Maggie's life as a lens through which to examine the intertwined issues of social reform and aging in America.<br /></p>

<p>Read her autobiography, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/No-Stone-Unturned-Times-Maggie/dp/0345373731""><em>No Stone Unturned: The Life and Times of Maggie Kuhn</em></a> and the excellent study of a movement, <a href=""http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14626.html""><em>Gray Panthers</em></a>, by anthropologist Roger Sanjek which should give you some new insights into us ""wrinkled radicals.""</p>
<p>I spend quite a few mornings each month checking into <a href=""http://margaretandhelen.com/"">Margaret and Helen's</a> blog, to see what those two intrepid and acerbic oldsters have to say about recent events.</p>
<p>They do not disappoint. Helen had plenty to say about the first presidential debate. I savor her opening salvo.</p>
<blockquote>Well Margaret, once again I am going to say what the media won?t. Mitt Romney is a lying sack of shit and he wouldn?t know a middle class tax cut if it bit him in the middle of his gold plated ass.</blockquote>

<br />
<p>As the curator of the Daily Kos Elections Polling Wrap, one trend in the 2012 electoral cycle that has not escaped my attention has been the relative paucity of polling in this presidential election cycle, when compared to other cycles.</p>
<p>For example, in 2008, there were 2,730 polls released in either presidential or downballot races, not counting national or primary polls. This year, despite having a much better method of gathering polling data (to say nothing of the assistance of the rest of the Daily Kos Elections team, something I did not have in 2008), this election year has brought just over 1,450 polls to-date. To put it another way, to merely match 2008's polling output, we would need to average a release of about 300-350 polls per week for the rest of the cycle. That is, suffice to say, unlikely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we learned this week that the 2012 polling blackout is going to extend to what every losing candidate colloquially refers to as ""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/04/networks-ap-cancel-exit-polls-in-19-states/"">the only poll that matters</a>"":<br /></p>
<blockquote>Breaking from two decades of tradition, this year?s election exit poll is set to include surveys of voters in 31 states, not all 50 as it has for the past five presidential elections, according to multiple people involved in the planning.
<p>Dan Merkle, director of elections for ABC News, and a member of the consortium that runs the exit poll, confirmed the shift Thursday. The aim, he said, ?is to still deliver a quality product in the most important states,? in the face of mounting survey costs.</p>
<p>The decision by the National Election Pool ? a joint venture of the major television networks and The Associated Press ? is sure to cause some pain to election watchers across the country.</p>
</blockquote>
While mournful, the decision nevertheless had seemed somewhat inevitable. With rising costs, and dwindling resources, we have already seen the major media outlets make slashing cuts to their polling budgets, with few media outlets even polling weekly, with only a month to go until the election.
<p>The criteria for inclusion and exclusion is predicated solely on the presidential race, it would seem. One imagines that the typical consumer of the media outlets only cares about the presidential race, and that gives the NEP the green light to cut states that are generally conceded to be safely in the corner of either President Obama or Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>With this in mind, these were the 20 entities (including the District of Columbia) that were summoned to the polling guillotine by the media outlets:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.</blockquote>
The casual observer might look at this collection of states and say, ""So what? These are all dark-red and dark-blue states. What is the big deal?""

There's a lot of big money behind California's Proposition 32, which should tell you right away how much to believe its backers' claims that the ballot initiative is about getting money out of politics. Most recently, Charles Munger, Jr., the son of the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, this week gave <a href=""http://blogs.sacbee.com/the_state_worker/2012/10/charles-munger-doubles-down-to-defeat-prop-30-support-prop-32.html"">$9.9 million</a> to a committee aimed at simultaneously supporting Prop. 32 and defeating Gov. Jerry Brown's tax measure; Munger has now given a total of $20 million to those two fights. Meanwhile, good-government groups like the <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/10/league-of-women-voters-stars-in-new-prop-32-ad.html"">League of Women Voters</a> are lining up against Prop. 32 along with the unions it explicitly targets.
<p>Prop. 32 eliminates a key union fundraising tool. Then it restricts direct contributions to candidates by unions and some kinds of corporations. That's meant to look like ""getting special interest money out of politics,"" in the hope that you won't notice that corporate big money could still put unlimited amounts of money into outside spending and Super PACs, while unions would have lost the ability to compete financially (to the small extent they currently do). California Republicans are hoping that if this passes, they'd finally be able to start winning statewide elections.</p>
<p>Munger is not the only super-rich guy supporting Prop. 32. According to Frying Pan News, the go-to source for reporting on who's behind this initiative, other major donors include <a href=""http://fryingpannews.org/2012/09/13/meet-john-dough-proposition-32s-top-donors/"">major supporters of Prop. 8</a> and of <a href=""http://fryingpannews.org/2012/10/02/an-education-how-prop-32s-backers-have-tried-to-ditch-public-schools/"">education privatization via vouchers</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, Larry T. Smith, ""a prominent proponent of 'gay-to-straight' conversion therapy for minors ... personally donated $50,000 to help support Prop. 8 and funneled even more money to the campaign through his political action group, the Family Action PAC."" Fellow Prop. 32 donor Howard Ahmanson gave $1.4 million to Prop. 8, as well as giving ""millions to both creationist and school-voucher causes."" Also on the school vouchers front, Timothy C. Draper has given $100,000 to support Prop. 32:<br /></p>
<blockquote>In 2000 Draper was the brains and the piggybank behind Proposition 38?arguably the most extreme school voucher effort in recent American history. The measure would have drained California public school coffers to give students up to $4,000 in taxpayer-funded vouchers to pay for private schools. The bill included no means testing, so that children of privilege who were already attending California?s prep schools would be given an unneeded subsidy for their elite education.</blockquote>
Likewise, ""Former Univision CEO Jerry Perenchio gave $1,040,000 to back Prop. 38 and to date has donated $250,000 to Prop. 32."" He's also a big donor to Karl Rove's American Crossroads.

<p>""Ah, Biden,"" he said, walking briskly across the eagle at the center of the carpet. ""Here. See what you make of this.""</p>
<p>I took the folded paper from his outstretched had and began to read.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/douthat-it-could-be-his-party.html"">Ross Douthat</a></p>
<blockquote>What Romney executed on Wednesday night was not just a simple pivot to the center ... what he did was clarify, elevate and translate. He clarified what kind of tax reformer he would be, by promising that revenue neutrality would take priority over sweeping cuts for the rich ? a premise that plenty of Republicans are already happy to accept. ... And he translated the basic free-market vision to a nonideological audience, by talking more about decent jobs than heroic job creators, and more about the struggling middle class than about the supposedly persecuted John Galts.</blockquote>
I stared at the words and scowled. ""But Obama,"" I said. ""Romney has never expressed any concern for the middle class, and neither has this Douthat fellow.""
<p>""Precisely,"" said Obama. &nbsp;""In fact, Mr. Romney's opinions are well known to fall firmly in line with this sentiment."" With this he indicated the next item on the creased sheet of newsprint.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/republicans-to-cities-drop-dead.html"">Kevin Baker</a></p>
<blockquote>The Republican Party is, more than ever before in its history, an anti-urban party, its support gleaned overwhelmingly from suburban and rural districts ? especially in presidential elections. ... For Republicans, cities became object lessons on the shortcomings of activist government and the welfare state ? sinkholes of crime and social dysfunction, where Ronald Reagan?s ?welfare queens? cavorted in their Cadillacs. ...
<p>The national Republican Party still can?t get seem to get past its animus toward the very idea of urban life. The only place that Amtrak turns a profit is the Northeast corridor ? yet all Republicans can think to do is privatize it, along with the local rail lines on which millions of Americans have been commuting into cities to work for as long as a century and a half. Republicans promise to ban same-sex marriage, make it easier for anyone to get a gun, delegitimize and destroy what they mockingly call ?public employees? unions,? and deport the immigrant workers performing so many thankless but vital tasks.</p>
<p>In short, they promise to rip and tear at the immensely complex fabric of city life while sneering at the entire ?urban vision of dense housing and government transit.? There is a terrible arrogance here that has ramifications well beyond the Republicans? electoral prospects.</p>
</blockquote>
Scanning the page, I found myself nodding in agreement. ""Yes, that certainly fits the Republican Party I know. Dismissive of most Americans, working to benefit only a few.""
<p>Obama folded his hands behind his back and stared at the rain splattered window. &nbsp;""And yet the man I shared a stage with this week professed none of those positions. How are we to reconcile this, Biden?"" A frown creased his strong features, and as it did I peered down at the words of</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/friedman-can-i-phone-a-friend.html"">Thomas Friedman</a></p>
<blockquote>Maybe we should have seen this coming. For weeks, Romney had performed so badly and had fallen so far behind in swing states that if this campaign were a Ryder Cup singles match, you?d have said the president felt he had the match in the bag with just a few holes left to play. So he did the worst thing you can do in match play golf: he started playing not to lose. He continued with an uninspired, vague and cautious campaign and just waited for Romney to keep hitting balls out of bounds. Romney, his back to the wall, had no choice but to start aggressively playing to win.</blockquote>
""Good lord,"" I exclaimed. ""What a supercilious asshole.""
<p>Obama broke into a grin as he turned back to me. ""Reading Friedman, are you? Well, Biden, there are some things that never change. &nbsp;But see here..."" &nbsp;He took another paper from his desk and passed it across to me.</p>
<p>""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-obama-was-kod-in-denver/2012/10/05/bbc5c5d4-0f23-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html"">Parker</a>?"" I asked, shaking my head. ""But I thought she didn't agree with Romney.""</p>
<p>""She doesn't. She never has."" &nbsp;He took the paper back sand strolled across the floor more slowly. ""Think on this, Biden. &nbsp;Willard Romney has spent months, even years, building up the story that he is a 'severe conservative'. &nbsp;He opposes improving health care, wants massive tax cuts for the rich, and desires little more than to decimate the programs that middle class Americans most favor."" Obama's pacing had brought him once again close to the window. He stared out, past his own reflection, into the gloom of the day. &nbsp;""And yet conservatives have done nothing but proclaim that Romney must move ever further to the right.""</p>
<p>""Well, yes. Of course.</p>
<p>""But the man who I met the other night took positions exactly the opposite. He disavowed every belief conservatives hold dear.""</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt cold fingers run along my spine. ""You can't mean... Someone has kidnapped Romney and substituted a reasonable man!""</p>
<p>Obama waved a dismissive hand. ""Of course not. Mitt Romney is simply a serial liar, willing to say whatever he thinks people want to hear at that moment. In that, he is absolutely consistent. We've learned nothing about Romney we didn't already know.""</p>
<p>I frowned again in confusion. ""But then, Obama, where is the mystery?""</p>
<p>""The mystery, my good Biden, is in the reaction of conservative Republicans."" He gave the page in his hand a shake. ""You see, despite all the claims about the importance of their positions, conservatives were willing to renounce their beliefs in a trice when it appeared they might gain advantage."" With a quick flip of his wrist, Obama sent the folded page spinning across the room where It landed quite neatly in a bin. ""It's not Romney that revealed himself as having no positions worth noting -- that much we knew already. &nbsp;It's the Republican Party that went missing on that stage.""</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Attorney General Eric Holder</div>
</div>
Here's a big win for Eric Holder, Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama. It's also evidence of how this administration really is <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/APbaee27d23e1e4d37b95c34f3f39eb100.html"">protecting Medicare</a>.<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON ? A federal strike force has charged 91 people, including a hospital president, doctors and nurses, with Medicare fraud schemes in seven cities involving $429 million in false billings. [...]
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that that in addition to the newly announced criminal charges, her agency used new authority under the Obama administration's health care law to stop future payments to many of the health care providers suspected of fraud.</p>
</blockquote>
Those charged include the president of a hospital in Houston along with six others who racked up $158 million in fraudulent billings, two doctors and two nurses in Dallas who for $103 million in fraudulent billings, and a doctor and four chiropractors in Brooklyn, who participated in a scheme netting $23 million. The other cases are in Baton Rouge, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. The <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/business/medicare-fraud-charged-against-91.html"">charges</a> include ""billing the government for unnecessary ambulance rides in California, writing prescriptions for patients in Dallas who did not qualify for them and paying kickbacks like food and cigarettes to patients in Houston if they attended programs for which a hospital could bill.""
<p>When politicians talk about waste, fraud and abuse, this is what they're talking about. And the Obama administration is actually doing something about it, cracking down on the fraud, but using Obamacare to prevent providers caught in fraud from ever gaming the system again.</p>

<p>He simply sends them a copy of the president?s birth certificate. [?]</p>
<p>?Since President Obama was elected, many individuals have expressed concerns regarding his citizenship and eligibility to serve as the President of the United States given the requirements delineated in the Constitution,? one of the letters says. ?On April 27, 2011, in response to these criticisms, President Obama released the long form of his birth certificate, which was issued by the Hawaii State Department of Health.?</p>
</blockquote>
Staple the birth certificate to that, boom, done. Good answer. Now can we <em>please</em> get back to deciding which of our grandmothers deserve Medicare and which don't, like decent, rational Americans? Sheesh.<br />

<p>Republicans and their media water-carriers are <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/05/1140826/-Jack-Welch-Dick-Nixon-and-the-Great-BLS-Jobs-Conspiracy"">apoplectic</a> about Friday's report showing the unemployment rate dipped to 7.8 percent in September as the U.S. economy added 114,000 new jobs. But while many conservatives have been quick to follow in Richard Nixon's footsteps in accusing the career civil servants at the BLS of cooking the books for President Obama by showing more robust employment growth this summer, there is one jobs report no Republican wants to talk about. Because in the spring of 2011, the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Economic Analysis revealed that the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/14/1045367/-Obama-on-the-Economy-We-Didn-t-Know-How-Bad-It-Was"">Bush recession was far more severe</a> than the incoming Obama administration knew at the time or Republicans want to admit now.</p>
<p>In late 2008, Barack Obama's transition team led by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein began planning the President-elect's response to the near collapse of the American financial system that fall. In readying what in February 2009 would become the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Romer and Bernstein estimated that unemployment would peak at 8 percent with the stimulus--and 9 percent without it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only much later did Obama's team--and the American people--learn just how catastrophic the U.S. economic situation was at the beginning of 2009.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/08/fiscal-policy"">The Economist</a> and the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/could-this-time-have-been-different/2011/08/25/gIQAiJo0VL_blog.html"">Washington Post's Ezra Klein</a> explained, in early 2009 the American economy was not only in much worse shape than anyone imagined; it was literally on the brink of collapse. As The Economist explained the run-up to the passage of the $787 billion recovery program:<br /></p>
<blockquote>The White House looked at the economic situation, sized up Congress, and took its shot. Unfortunately, the situation was far more dire than anyone in the administration or in Congress supposed.
<p>Output in the third and fourth quarters fell by 3.7% and 8.9%, respectively, not at 0.5% and 3.8% as believed at the time. Employment was also falling much faster than estimated. Some 820,000 jobs were lost in January, rather than the 598,000 then reported. In the three months prior to the passage of stimulus, the economy cut loose 2.2m workers, not 1.8m. In January, total employment was already 1m workers below the level shown in the official data.</p>
</blockquote>
As Klein summed it up last year:<br />
<blockquote>The reality has been worse than the administration's nightmare scenario. Even with the stimulus, unemployment shot past 10 percent in 2009.
<p>To understand how the administration got it so wrong, we need to look at the data it was looking at.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the agency charged with measuring the size and growth of the U.S. economy, initially projected that the economy shrank at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 2008. Months later, the bureau almost doubled that estimate, saying the number was 6.2 percent. Then it was revised to 6.3 percent. But it wasn't until this year that the actual number was revealed: 8.9 percent. That makes it one of the worst quarters in American history. Bernstein and Romer knew in 2008 that the economy had sustained a tough blow; they didn't know that it had been run over by a truck.</p>

Listing the rights and protections that are common around the world but that American workers don't have is downright depressing. One of the big areas? The ability to <i>not</i> work when you need time off: paid sick leave, parental leave, family leave, and more. Since women take on disproportionate amounts of care work, these are all things that hit women harder than men, creating one more obstacle for women to climb over in building and keeping careers. These issues take a back seat for too many Democratic politicians; Republicans, meanwhile, outright oppose anything that gives workers control over when they work. But women are <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/02/paid-sick-leave_n_1933379.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"">pushing to get paid leave on the agenda</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Only one in five low-wage workers have paid sick leave, and 48 percent of all full-time workers in the private sector have no access to paid medical or family leave. Dozens of women at a women's health town hall at the White House in June expressed the dire need for a federally funded paid maternity leave program. And while President Barack Obama did include a $50 million State Paid Leave Fundin his 2011 budget, the issue of paid time off has largely been ignored by candidates in the current campaign season.
<p>Jessica Smith, a 26-year-old graduate student of social work at the University of Denver, has circulated a petition asking moderator Jim Lehrer to question Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney about paid sick days and family leave insurance policies at the first presidential debate on Wednesday.</p>
</blockquote>
Since parental leave is so hard to come by, discrimination during pregnancy is another issue women have to worry about. The <a href=""http://www.inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13903/a_bill_to_make_employers_less_mean_to_pregnant_women/"">Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</a>:<br />
<blockquote>builds on existing anti-discrimination laws by extending specific protections to pregnant employees. The legislation directs employers to ?make reasonable accommodations"" for an employee or job applicant's &nbsp;limitations stemming from ""pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,? unless this would pose ?undue hardship? on the business. In addition, as the New York Times' Motherlode explains, the law would bar employers from ""using a worker?s pregnancy to deny her opportunities on the job [or] force her to take an accommodation that she does not want or need.? The bill also directs the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to set regulations for implementing these laws, including ?a list of exemplary reasonable accommodations.""</blockquote>

The bill was introduced by <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/08/1089814/-House-Democrats-introduce-Pregnant-Workers-Fairness-Act?detail=hide"">House Democrats</a> in May and by Senate Democrats in September and it stands zero chance of passage as long as Republicans control the House and filibuster everything in the Senate.
<p>We're talking about basic rights, here. Staying home when you or a member of your family is sick and still being able to pay the bills. Not losing your job because you're pregnant. Things workers around the world can count on that American workers can only dream about. And it's a dream, not a reality, because Republicans (and, unfortunately, some Democrats, like New York City council Speaker <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/18/1111389/-Sick-leave-for-more-than-1-65-million-New-Yorkers-being-blocked-by-council-Speaker-Christine-Quinn?detail=hide"">Christine Quinn</a>) are standing in the way.</p>
<p>The only chance we have at things like paid sick leave is electing Democrats, and then beating the hell out of the Democrats, like Quinn, who still stand in the way. So just as it took years of organizing and multiple tries to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, that's what we have to be ready for here. But the only way to even take the first step of getting the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (a very limited bill just prohibiting discrimination, for crying out loud) to a vote in the House is to get the gavel back in the hands of Speaker Pelosi. We're fighting here to even get the main event.</p>
<p><a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/speakerpelosi?refcode=10_02_leaveblog"">Please give $3 to each of the candidates on our Speaker Pelosi Project list</a> so we can get in the fight to outlaw discrimination against pregnant workers and get paid sick leave for all of us.</p>

You know by now about Mitt Romney's plan to save a teeny-intsy-weenie part of the budget, one one-hundredth of one percent, by firing Big Bird. Because deficit. And tax cuts for rich people. And his love for firing people. Birds. Whatever.
<p>Did you know, though, that his tax plan would also mean <a href=""http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20121005/FREE/121009956"">charitable deductions</a> would largely disappear for middle class people? So no federal money, and no benefit for donors giving to PBS. He really hates that Big Bird.</p>
<p>But did you further know that pretty much every sitting Republican member of Congress has voted <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">repeatedly</a> to <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">defund</a> public broadcasting?</p>
<p>That's why our whole slate of House candidates is included in <a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/helltopay?refcode=10_06_blog"">Hell to Pay</a> this week. Because they voted against Big Bird. Against Cookie Monster and Elmo and Snuffleupagus.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, some of our &nbsp;<a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/helltopay?refcode=10_06_blog"">Hell to Pay</a> candidates responded.</p>
<p><b>Carol Shea Porter's (NH-01)</b> campaign wants you to know where her opponent's priorities lie, and it ain't with the children:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Why are Congressman Frank Guinta and Mitt Romney taking aim at Big Bird? Why did Congressman Guinta vote to end funding for something that teaches our little ones and helps families? Congressman Guinta said that one of his highest priorities was to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. &nbsp;In Congress, he has voted to do just that.
<p>Naomi Andrews, Campaign Manager for Carol Shea-Porter, released the following statement. &nbsp;""Congressman Guinta needs to say no to Big Oil subsidies and yes to Big Bird and the Corporation For Public Broadcasting.""</p>
</blockquote>
Some of our other candidates wrote to let us know who they'd miss most from Sesame Street, and why:
<p><b>Kathy Boockvar (PA-08):</b><br /></p>
<blockquote>""I'll have to go with Oscar the Grouch before my morning coffee, and Grover afterwards, after he comes to peace with his inner monster.""</blockquote>
<b>Lois Frankel (FL-22):</b><br />
<blockquote>""I know that Mitt Romney and his campaign co-chair? my opponent?want to tell Big Bird, Bert, Elmo and &nbsp;the rest of the gang on Sesame Street to hit the road. &nbsp;Elmo has always been my favorite and I would hate to see him unemployed because of Mitt Romney. All of us could learn a lot from Elmo's positive attitude and optimistic outlook. The 'Elmo quality' is something more people in Washington need to emulate and it's amazing that the Republican's are trying to throw it out into the cold.""</blockquote>
<b>Betty Sutton (OH-16):</b><br />
<blockquote>Elmo's character is about inclusiveness?about teaching all children that love is important- loving your neighbor?your friend. &nbsp;It's also about learning?from colors to safety?to bedtime routines and how to buy things in a store. He is a character that helps children learn about the world in a way I think we all strive to be?more accepting, more tolerant, more kind, and above all, more loving of the people around us.</blockquote>
<b>Pat Kreitlow (WI-07):</b><br />
<blockquote>""The Count?Because Bill Clinton proved we need math skills beyond grade school, and especially in Congress. Also, there's an acCOUNTability joke somewhere in there, but I won't do that to you Joan.""</blockquote>
<b>Annie Kuster (NH-01):</b>
<p><a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/helltopay?refcode=10_06_blog""><img align=""right"" alt=""Goal Thermometer"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/i.actblue.com/page/helltopay/thermometer/dark-short.png"" /></a></p>
<blockquote>Favorite character: The Count
<p>Why: If House Republicans had the Count's accounting skills, perhaps they'd have done a better job reducing the deficit.</p>
</blockquote>
You can sure tell these folks aren't Republicans!
<p>Let's see how far we can go to strike a blow for Elmo and Oscar and the Count. And especially Bert and Ernie (you know know how much Republicans hate Bert and Ernie).</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">The beginning of an era of Mitt Romney being <s>bipartisan</s> the same entitled jerk he always is.</div>
</div>
Mitt Romney <a href=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/romney-takes-liberties-with-bipartisan-claims-about-past/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto"">made much</a> of his supposed bipartisan skills in Wednesday night's debate. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139793/-Mitt-Romney-Lying-to-victory?detail=hide"">By this time</a>, it may not surprise you to hear that he was stretching the truth.<br />
<blockquote>As a Republican governor whose legislature was 87 percent Democrats, he said, ""I figured out from Day 1 I had to get along, and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done."" The result, he said, was that ""we drove our schools to be No. 1 in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.""</blockquote>
Romney <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139858/-Massachusetts-schools-are-great-but-don-t-credit-Mitt-Romney-with-that?detail=hide"">didn't deserve credit</a> for Massachusetts schools that were already great when he became governor, the tax cuts include a number that came from the legislature, ""routine extensions of existing tax reductions that were due to expire,"" and two one-day sales tax holidays. Additionally, Romney was famous for raising fees on basically everything he could think of.
<p>And about that bipartisanship. Massachusetts state legislators, though heavily Democratic, were used to working with Republican governors. But while there were moments Romney worked with them successfully?passing the precursor to Obamacare, for instance?Massachusetts legislators by and large remember him as exactly the entitled jerk we see running for president now. One frequently cited example of that entitlement is the elevator in the State House that Romney reserved for himself, banning state legislators from using it. They also talk about the security ropes he had installed outside his office. And about how it was impossible to get a meeting with him and he didn't bother to learn the names of the legislators who he now tells us he worked so hard to get bipartisan with.</p>
<p>It's not just legislators, either. Romney also kept his distance from the state's <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/was-mitt-romney-a-good-governor/257942/"">mayors</a>:<br /></p>
<blockquote>John Barrett, who was mayor of the city of North Adams during Romney's governorship, described him Thursday as ""a governor who just ignored us, who didn't want our effort,"" saying he never met with mayors or sought their input. ""He believed that a PowerPoint presentation would solve all our problems,"" Barrett said.</blockquote>
One Democratic mayor did have a positive experience with Romney. <a href=""http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/2012/09/mass-revolt-mitt-romney-campaign-in-massachusetts/"">But</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When Kalisz relayed the story to his fellow mayors, though, a funny thing happened: Nobody believed him. ?They thought I was joking when I said he was physically in my office,? Kalisz says.</blockquote>
Taking a shared elevator and keeping it for himself, security ropes, refusing to meet with legislators and mayors. Sound like bipartisanship to you? And that was in a state mostly controlled by Democrats?Romney wouldn't face nearly the same pressure to work with Democrats when it comes to a sharply divided U.S. Congress. The meetings with Democrats that he claims would happen on Day One would be much more likely to happen on Day Never.

<a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82081.html#ixzz28RwkTyAH"">Culture of something</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The owner of a Denver restaurant who has received death threats after declining a visit by Mitt Romney said Friday that he ?could feel the hate in the air? at his business recently.
<p>?On Thursday, it was horrible,? Oscar Aguirre, the owner of Rosa Linda?s Mexican Cafe, told POLITICO. ?It was dead. Yesterday during lunch, you could feel the hate in the air.?</p>
</blockquote>
Aguirre's crime was that a Romney aide asked if they could hold an official Romney campaign event there, Aguirre said no thanks, and that was that. But that wasn't that, because he then started getting emails, and phone calls, from disgruntled conservatives put out that he would do such a horrible thing.
<p>It hasn't gotten quite as farcical as the ridiculousness that ensued after a Florida pizzeria owner hugged Barack Obama, leading to <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57509622-503544/bear-hug-pizza-man-becomes-subject-of-yelp-war/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CBSNewsHealthyLiving+%28CBS+News%3A+Healthy+Living%29"">a nationwide effort by dimwits to give him bad reviews on Yelp</a>, but anything that includes ""death threats"" is pretty damn bad.</p>
<p>On the other side of things, there was the bakery owner who declined a visit by Joe Biden. <a href=""http://www.wdbj7.com/news/wdbj7-radford-business-owner-declines-joe-bidens-request-to-stop-in-store-20120815,0,4370357.story"">It seems like that worked out better, yes?</a><br /></p>
<blockquote>Back at the bakery, a couple of guys said they'd hoped to see Biden and didn't care that the VP had been turned away.
<p>""I mean it really doesn't matter to me. Everyone has their own views so I love the food here anyway. I agree. Everybody's different so I could care less,"" said Spenser Critterton of Radford.</p>
</blockquote>
? and then Biden's secret service detail bought a bunch of cookies.
<p>Really, folks, it's fine if a small business does not want to host Giant Political Event-Type Thingy. There are many reasons why a business might not want to do such a thing. There are many reasons why they would. If you're getting worked up over <em>that</em>, you may need to consider whether you are investing your political time wisely.<br /></p>

The Obama campaign is highlighting Mitt Romney's debate lies in a web video. Given the volume of untruth we're talking about, a two-minute video can only skim the surface, but running through the big lies is brutal enough (shoot, the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140029/-Obama-ad-hammers-Romney-for-lying-about-his-tax-plan-during-debate?detail=hide"">ad</a> released Thursday that only touched on tax policy was pretty hard-hitting itself).

<li>Yet <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Health/boy-scout-bullied-denied-eagle-rank-gay/story?id=17401340#.UG_w1VFFs4m"">another embarrassing action</a> by the homophobic, theocratic Boy Scouts:<br />
<blockquote>Ryan Andresen has spent a decade completing the requirements for the coveted Eagle Scout award, and now that he is just about to turn 18 -- the cut-off date for attaining the highest honor -- his Boy Scout troop won't approve it because he is gay.
<p>His project, a ""tolerance wall,"" was inspired by the years of hazing he endured in middle school in Moraga, Calif., and later at Boy Scout summer camp, where his nicknames were ""Tinkerbell"" and ""faggot.""</p>
<p>""I had I had no idea what gay was at that point,"" said Andresen, who described hazing that included, among other rituals, having the word ""fag"" written in charcoal across his chest.</p>
</blockquote>
Yep. In the world of the Boy Scouts, bullies can get badges just fine. The people they bully? Not so much. ""Duty to God"" and all that.</li>
<li><a href=""http://esciencenews.com/articles/2012/10/04/abortion.rates.plummet.with.free.birth.control"">No, really:</a><br />
<blockquote>When women are given access to birth control at no cost, the rate of unintended pregnancies and abortions among them drops dramatically, according to a new study published on Thursday in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology.
<p>The Contraceptive Choice Project, conducted by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Mo., enrolled 9,256 women and teens from 14 to 45 years of age in the St. Louis area between 2007 and 2011. The participants were all uninsured, low-income, or otherwise determined to be at risk for unintended pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
You mean, when women have easy access to medication that will prevent pregnancies, pregnancies are prevented? What a shock!</li>
<li>For those keeping score at home, conservatives seem to think that President Obama is a lazy, shiftless and stupid black man who somehow has the capacity to arrange a wholesale conspiracy to fudge the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report while leaving absolutely no evidence of ever having done so. Because, logic!</li>
<li>Steve Doocy <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/10/05/doocy-lawmaker-who-wont-pray-in-public-shouldnt-use-money-with-in-god-we-trust/"">is insane</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fox News co-host Steve Doocy on Friday suggested that Pennsylvania state lawmaker Babette Josephs (D) should not use U.S. currency that includes the words ?In God We Trust? because she has said that she does not pray in public.
<p>During a Pennsylvania House State Government Committee meeting on Wednesday, Josephs had declined to lead the Pledge of Allegiance because it included the words ?under God.?</p>
<p>?Based on my First Amendment rights and based on the fact that I really think it?s a prayer,? she explained. ?I don?t pray in public.?</p>

Remember that Doocy is the same jackass who wondered if the 47% percent deserve to be able to vote.</li>

<p>Some good news out of Los Angeles County. California just implemented online voter registration, and according to a release, about 60% of those who registered to vote in the county in the first week of its availability registered as Democrats:<br /></p>
<blockquote>LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles County Democratic Party (LACDP) reported that in the first week of online voter registration being available in California almost 60% of all those in LA County registered with the Democratic Party, and announced the next phase of the Party's outreach efforts focusing on spreading the word about registering to vote by mail online
<p>Eric C. Bauman, LACDP Chair and Vice-Chair of the California Democratic Party said, ""I'm proud to announce our new public awareness campaign to heavily push online vote-by-mail registration, because even a small increase in Democrats voting by mail will help us re-elect President Obama and Senator Feinstein, pass Prop 30, beat back Prop 32, make major gains in the State Assembly and Senate and put the Speaker's gavel back in Nancy Pelosi's hands.""</p>
<p>According to LA County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan, approximately 50,785 voters registered online during the first week of availability, 30,340 of which registered as Democrats.</p>
</blockquote>
This number may not seem hugely important because Los Angeles is a blue county--but as of a month ago, Democratic voter registration in the county was <a href=""http://rrcc.lacounty.gov/VOTER/PDFS/STATEMENT_REGISTRATION/09072012.pdf"">a shade over 50%</a>, which would make 60% of new registrants being Democrats a huge improvement.</li>
<li>A sane Republican? <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/10/05/964121/scott-tipton-enda/"">Who knew?</a><br />
<blockquote>DENVER, Colorado ? A Republican Congressman has broken with his party and announced his support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a key piece of legislation that would make it illegal to discriminate against LGBT individuals in the workplace.
<p>?I don?t believe we ought to be discriminating against people for their private lives,? Rep. Scott Tipton (R-CO) explained to ThinkProgress outside Wednesday?s presidential debate. ?I?m a businessman. When you walk in the door, if you?re able to do the job and you?re focused on your job, that?s all that?s important.""</p>

Last spring, student teachers at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/07/1089438/-For-profit-teacher-licensing-draws-resistance-from-Massachusetts-student-teachers?detail=hide"">refused to participate</a> in a pilot teacher licensing program that would replace real-life classroom observation with a take-home test and edited videos of the prospective teacher in the classroom. The new teacher licensing would be done for profit by testing company <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/29/1085807/-Testing-driven-education-means-giant-corporate-profits-and-pineapples-don-t-have-sleeves-?detail=hide"">Pearson</a>, and 67 of the 68 student teachers training for middle school and high school teaching at UMass said no. Within weeks, the director of the secondary-teacher education program who had trained them and had spoken out against the new licensing system got a letter saying her contract wouldn't be renewed when it expired a year later.
<p>The <i>New York Times</i>' Michael Winerip, who last spring wrote about the 67 students' refusal to film themselves for licensing by Pearson, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/booming/01winerip-booming.html?ref=michaelwinerip&amp;_r=0"">writes now</a> of Barbara Madeloni that:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Ms. Madeloni is 55 and has been overseeing the university?s program to train middle and high school teachers for nine years. During that time, she has repeatedly been rated ?outstanding.? (?We applaud Dr. Madeloni for her work,? read her December 2011 evaluation.) [...]
<p>?They?ve been angry at me for a long time, but I believe the article pushed them over the edge,? she said this week. ?For several years this has been building inside me, this reliance on standardized tests to evaluate teachers.</p>
<p>?It?s so degrading,? she said. ?For a long time I decided not to fight it. I wouldn?t have been able to do this at 40. I don?t think I could have stayed as grounded. You have to be able to manage people saying awful, awful things.?</p>
</blockquote>
The university administration insists the decision not to renew Madeloni's contract was completely unrelated to her anti-standardization activism and the publicity that resulted. (<a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/28/1114239/-This-week-in-the-War-on-Workers-Another-Hyatt-activist-is-out-of-work-Coincidentally-Hyatt-says?detail=hide"">It's always a coincidence!</a>) Ironically, the way the administration was able to get rid of her was to convert her position into a tenure-track one?so the next person hired to fill this role will be able to speak up from a less vulnerable position. But how much do you want to bet that they do their best to hire someone who'll be complacent?

<p>The biggest news this week came Tuesday when Republican Judge Robert Simpson, under pressure from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, <a href=""http://www.pacourts.us/NR/rdonlyres/CFBF4323-B964-4846-8179-88D689375C10/0/CMWSuppDetAppPrelInjOrder_100212.pdf"">blocked the most important part</a> of the state's much-disputed voter-ID law.</p>
<p>Simpson did not overturn the whole law (or his previous decision in the matter). In fact, the law is still valid. But for the November election, even though poll workers can ask for one of the few approved forms of ID, Pennsylvanians without one will be allowed to vote just like any other citizen. Before the ruling, they would have only been allowed to cast a provisional ballot. The court will further examine the law after the election.</p>
<p>Although a news agency reported that Republican Gov. Tom Corbett would not appeal the law to the state supreme court, and I repeated that report <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/03/1139233/-Voter-ID-laws-take-another-hit-in-Mississippi-no-appeal-coming-in-Pennsylvania-ruling"">here</a>, so far he has only said he is <em>leaning</em> in the direction of not appealing the ruling. One reason behind the reluctance to do so is no doubt the previous ruling by the high court that vacated the original decision by Judge Simpson. The wording of that ruling would seem to make any appeal unlikely of success.</p>
<p>State Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, the Republican legislator who pushed the law into existence isn't too happy. The judge's decision, Metcalfe <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/state/20121004_Ronnie_Polaneczky_.html"">said</a>, ""is skewed in favor of the lazy, who refuse to exercise the necessary work ethic to meet the common-sense requirements to obtain an acceptable photo ID.""</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has the strictest new voter-ID law in the country, but it is only one 15 states that have tightened their ID restrictions since 2008. Courts have approved the laws of three states?New Hampshire, Indiana and Georgia. In addition to Pennsylvania, court rulings or other legal action have at least temporarily blocked the laws in Texas, Wisconsin, Mississippi and South Carolina, although a federal court could change the situation depending on its ruling in the last case.</p>
<p>The laws, all of which were passed in GOP-dominated legislatures, place a discriminatory burden on the poor, minorities, the elderly and other citizens who vote heavily Democratic.</p>
<p>Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice, the nation's largest non-partisan &nbsp;source of voting rights research, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/us/pennsylvania-judge-delays-implementation-of-voter-id-law.html"">said</a>: ?Every voter restriction that has been challenged this year has been either enjoined, blocked or weakened. It has been an extraordinary string of victories for those opposing these laws.?</p>
<p>However, said Penda D. Hair, a co-director of the Advancement Project, one of several groups that challenged the law Pennsylvania law:<br /></p>
<blockquote>?While we?re happy that voters in Pennsylvania will not be turned away if they do not have an ID, we are concerned that the ruling will allow election workers to ask for ID at the polls, and this could cause confusion. This injunction serves as a mere Band-Aid for the law?s inherent problems, not an effective remedy.?</blockquote>
<div class=""dkimg-r""><span class=""image_container""><img alt=""Voter button"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/6907/small/NoVote.png?1348452168"" /></span></div>
In fact, Judge Simpson labeled this a ""soft run,"" according to <em>The New York Times.</em> Amy Davidson <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2012/10/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-delay.html#ixzz28P0kZwmM"">raised cogent points</a> in this regard:<br />
<blockquote>What effect will that have on people standing on line, who see those in front of them asked to produce something that they themselves might not be carrying? And Pennsylvania has an obligation now to make sure that all of the people who?ve been admonished to get their photo on a card now know that they don?t have to. No state, and no country, is better off for reducing civic participation?we have, if anything, an extra interest in making sure that the people least likely to keep waiting in a long line do so. A person who has spoken by voting is more likely to listen.</blockquote>
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party, Working America, the Voter ID Coalition and other groups that have been engaged in get-out-the-vote efforts, including informing citizens about the voter-ID requirements, <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20121003_Activists_on_voter-ID_ruling__Happy_but_still_working.html"">have not packed up</a> their operations. The Voter ID Coalition, comprising 140 civic, educational, legal, community and religious groups, will be retooling their door-hangers and other materials with the idea that while voter-ID will not be required this time, next time it will.
<p>In addition, said Ellen Mattleman Kaplan, vice president of the Committee of Seventy, a century-old good-government group in Philadelphia, Simpson's ruling didn't change things for first-time voters or people voting for the first time in a new district. An older law already requires such citizens to show ID.</p>

And we?ve made too much progress to return to the policies that got us into this mess in the first place.</blockquote>
<div align=""center""></div>
<p>President Barack Obama trumpeted <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/05/1139397/-Government-reports-increase-of-114-000-official-rate-of-unemployment-drops-to-7-8-U6-is"">yesterday's jobs numbers</a> and for the third week in a row called on Americans to tell Congress to get back to work passing bills.</p>
<p>He pointed to tougher regulation of Wall Street and ""the strongest consumer protections in our history"" as accomplishments his administration pushed through?and ones Republicans are determined to tear down should they get the chance.<br /></p>
<blockquote>But for some reason, some Republicans in Congress are still waging an all-out battle to delay, defund and dismantle these commonsense new rules.
<p>Why? Do they think undoing rules that protect families from the worst practices of credit card companies and mortgage lenders will make the middle class stronger? Do they think getting rid of rules to prevent another crisis on Wall Street will make Main Street any safer?</p>
</blockquote>
Of course not. But if they want to at least pretend to be putting the interests of middle-class Americans first, he said, there are three things they can do:
<ul>
<li>Pass tax cuts for middle-class Americans</li>
<li>Pass mortgage refinancing legislation</li>
<li>Get a veterans job corps off the ground</li>
</ul>
<p>But that, of course, would require Congress to do its freaking job. So ?.<br /></p>
<blockquote>Ask them to get back to work and get these things done. If we?re going to keep this economy moving forward, there?s no time for political games. Even in a political season. Everyone needs to do their part. If you agree with me, let your Representative know where you stand. Tell them that if they want your vote, then they need to stand with you and not in the way of our recovery.</blockquote>

The Arctic isn't the only thing that's shrinking. New analysis comes to the shocking conclusion that half of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is gone. <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/03/947221/the-great-dwindling-barrier-reef-loses-half-its-coral-cover-in-under-30-years/"">The culprits</a>?
<blockquote>Yet according to this new study, the degradation is less directly linked to these usual suspects. Just 10 percent of the loss was attributable to bleaching. The study found coastal storms were the leading culprit that caused 48 percent of the damage, and the remaining 42 percent was a result of an exploding population of the crown of thorns starfish that preys on coral.
<p>Don?t mistake these causes for reason to think climate change isn?t responsible. After all, an increase in intensity of coastal storms is undoubtedly a symptom of planetary warming.</p>

<p>The graph below compares two-party vote share for Obama in 2008, by state, with last night's estimates from our model-based poll averaging. Pre-debate and nationwide, Obama was performing about a percentage point below the 2008 election result, from just over 53 percent (2008) to just over 52 percent (current estimate from our model-based poll averaging). Most states appear to be swinging away from Obama by a similar amount. This small amount of swing isn't translating into many states changing hands relative to 2008. A large win for Obama in the Electoral College is the clear implication of the current polling and our modeling.</p>

<p>In Utah, Scott Howell, a Democrat, has been arguing that if the 78-year-old Senator Orrin Hatch wins, he might ?die before his term is through.? Suggesting a longtime incumbent is over the hill is a venerable election technique, but you really are supposed to be a little more delicate about it. Howell also proposed having 29 debates.

David Dayen <a href=""http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/10/05/alan-simpson-i-get-so-damn-sick-and-tired-of-listening-to-the-little-guy/"">has encountered</a> a comment from Alan Simpson that ought to be bronzed and thrust into the face of every Democrat (including the one in the White House) who invokes the name of Simpson-Bowles in discussions of budgets and deficits:<br />
<br />
<table align=""center"" width=""96%"">
<tr>
<td>
<blockquote>SIMPSON: I get so damn sick and tired of listening to the little guy, the vulnerable, the veteran ? I am a veteran, and the seniors and this and this and this and the meanwhile this country is headed for second-class status while everybody just babbles into the vapor.</blockquote>
Where is the evidence that Alan Simpson has ever in his life listened to ?the little guy?? He?s really sick and tired of the PUBLIC listening to those pleas ? in other word, he doesn?t like the public thinking for themselves, with appeals from those who look and talk and think like them. He?d much rather the rest of the country worked the way it works in Washington, where the little guy remains silent while the blob of corporate lobbyists and consultants and associated grifters dominate the conversation. The vulnerable never penetrate the minds of the political class, save for maybe two or three weeks around election season. The rest of the time, they?re just 300 million moochers sucking at the public teat.
<p>Simpson really wants to shut down this thing we call democracy, so the enlightened, self-appointed guardians can go about looting the public treasury in peace. In your best interest.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is why Simpson was supposed to be put out to pasture, in favor of younger model Judd Gregg. But Washington has elevated Simpson and his balcony partner Erskine Bowles to such heights, and elevated their B-S plan (that stands for Bowles-Simpson, what else could it stand for) as well, that he couldn?t extricate himself from the spotlight. And these are the results.</p>

Bernard, senior fellow with the Independent Women's Forum. ""This attack by Eleanor Smeal and company is wholly unwarranted.""</p>
</blockquote>
IWF was the spin-off of Women for Clarence Thomas. Its first executive director was Barbara Ledeen, wife of Michael Ledeen. Among other notables who have served on its board are Rumsfeld hagiographer Midge Dector, who wrote a 1972 book called <i>The New Chastity and Other Arguments Against Women's Liberation,</i> Ted Olson and Larry Kudlow (yes, that Kudlow).
<p>The IWF mission: ?to combat the women-as-victim, pro-big-government ideology of radical feminism.?</p>

If today's rather modest amount of data is alarming or depressing to regular readers of the Polling Wrap, allow me to use, perhaps for the first time, a very old cliché: consider the source.
<p>Perhaps I, along with the universe of political junkies, should have seen this one coming. Less than 36 hours after the first presidential debate, the two most well-known right-leaning ""robopollsters"" in the game are out with swing state polls, culled from single-day samples. And their results, perhaps not surprisingly, have been exceptionally kind to the Republican nominee.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that they take pretty different approaches to their polls, even though the toplines are somewhat similar.</p>
<p>What is even more interesting is how badly one of those pollsters might have pissed away their credibility in their polling memo. You'll have to read it for yourself, it really is <i>that</i> bad.</p>
<p>For now, though, on to the numbers:<br /></p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Scott Brown talks about his model justice.</div>
</div>
Does Scott Brown agree with his <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/02/1138666/-Meet-Antonin-Scalia-Scott-Brown-s-kind-of-Supreme-Court-Justice"">model Supreme Court Justice</a>, Antonin Scalia, on these <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/10/05/scalia_says_outlawing_abortion_and_homosexual_sodomy_are_judicial_no_brainers/"">opinions he offered</a> at an American Enterprise Institute event this week?<br />
<blockquote>?The death penalty? Give me a break. It?s easy. Abortion? Absolutely easy. Nobody ever thought the Constitution prevented restrictions on abortion,? he said. ?Homosexual sodomy? Come on. For 200 years, it was criminal in every state.? [...]
<p>It takes a special kind of man to shrug off challenges to death penalty and abortion restrictions with nary a care in the world about how his interpretations of text might affect real human lives, and to use the phrase ?homosexual sodomy? in 2012. Give him this though: He?s consistent, down to his language. In 2003, when the Supreme Court struck down Texas sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, paving the way for a more widespread dissolution of similar statutes in other states, Scalia wrote the dissenting opinion. At the time, he argued that ?nowhere does the Court?s opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a ?fundamental right,?? adding, ?It is clear from this that <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZD.html"">the Court has taken sides in the culture war</a>, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children?s schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive.?</p>

<p>That dissent from Scalia has been around for a decade, so Brown can hardly claim ignorance of Scalia's extremism. Not just on ""homosexual sodomy"" but also on choice, which Brown continues to insist, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/24/1123699/-Scott-Brown-a-senator-who-votes-prolife"">despite all evidence</a> to the contrary, he supports.</p>
<p>It's about time the traditional media stop asking about Elizabeth Warren's heritage, and start asking about Scott Brown's real ideology.</p>

It's actually past ironic that the man now accusing the Obama White House of cooking today?s unemployment report is the same man who just a few months back complained that the Obama White House is keeping an <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/47035575/Former_GE_CEO_Jack_Welch_Blasts_Obama_s_Leadership"">enemies list</a> that ?would make Richard Nixon proud.?

Hello, human diary. It is I again, Mitt Romney, your better.
<p>These commoners continue to confound me. Of all the things my campaign has focused on over the last few months, now it is firing a large television bird that is gaining the most attention? I have already clearly explained to them that we will need to fire that bird in order to pay for the required tax cuts for job creators, by which I mean myself. If we do not fire large swaths of people, we will not be able to create jobs, and the number of people who will need jobs will be much greater after we have fired them all so it make sense to fire as many of them as possible in order to create those jobs.</p>
<p>Wealthy Americans have no use for improperly tall television birds. I have watched that show before, and found it boring, pedantic and entirely implausible. Why do these obviously lower class residents not simply eat the large bird? Why are unidentifiable creatures allowed to live in garbage cans?is there no law enforcement at all, in America? And C should not be for Cookie. C should be for Capitalism, or perhaps for Credit Default Swaps. At the least we ought to be teaching these irritatingly perky little urchins about proper wealth management techniques.</p>
<p>My apologies, Mr. Diary, I am just reminded of how misguided these commoner units are. In better news, my post-debate experiment in forgoing all sleep continues. So far everything seems to be going smoothly.<br /></p>

Now Mitt Romney has done it. He's <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/mitt-romney-big-bird_n_1940400.html?ref=topbar"">pissed off eight-year-old</a> Alabama resident Cecelia Crawford.<br />
<blockquote>On Thursday morning, she was still angry, so she wrote Romney a letter, sent along to The Huffington Post by her mother. Crawford wrote that she is a fan of ""Sesame Street"" and that it was her ""favorite show on earth"" when she was younger.
<p>""When I grow up I'm going to get married and I want my kids to watch it so do not cut it off,"" Crawford wrote. ""You find something else to cut off!""</p>

I can think of a few things that could be cut off, but how about we start with the Republican House of Representatives that has <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">voted repeatedly</a> to <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">defund public broadcasting</a>.
<p>They say <a href=""http://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2011/03/house-votes-defund-npr-minnesota-delegation-splits-along-party-lines"">things like this</a>, from Rep. Chip Cravaack:<br /></p>
<blockquote>""It is small, but the small ones add up. A bunch of drops in the bucket fill the pail,"" said Chip Cravaack of cutting NPR's federal dollars out of the entire budget. ""We can't keep on funding programs that are on [our children's] dime, we have to stop. We have to look for savings anywhere we can.""</blockquote>
Nice one there, Chip. Say it's all for the children as you're slashing Sesame Street. They'll sure thank you for that, you heartless bastard. You and every single other Republican our Orange to Blue House candidates are taking on.

Transcript:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Mitt Romney, 10/3/12:</strong> I will not reduce the taxes paid by high income Americans.
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 2/22/12:</strong> There were so many misrepresentations in there it's going to take me a little while. Number one, I said today that we're going to cut taxes on everyone across the country by twenty percent?including the top one percent.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 10/3/12:</strong> The key to great schools? Great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 6/8/12:</strong> He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 10/3/12:</strong> Actually, it's a lengthy description, but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 3/27/12:</strong> If they're 45 years old and they show up and they say I want insurance because I've got heart disease, it's like: ""Hey guys, we can't play the game like that."" You've got to get insurance when you're well, and then if you get ill, then you're going to be covered.</p>
</blockquote>
The only thing you can trust about Mitt Romney is that he'll say whatever he thinks he needs to say to get what he wants.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">WAKE UP, SHEEPLE</div>
</div>
Come on, SHEEPLE. Please don't tell me you believe any of <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/49305192"">this tripe</a>! Obviously the government is going to lie about a bogus jobs report that the <i>government</i> ginned up!<br />
<blockquote>Given the rush to question the legitimacy of the jobs report, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis felt it necessary to respond to the critics, and appeared on CNBC to say, ""I'm insulted when I hear that, because we have a very professional civil service ... have the highest regard for our professionals that do the calculations at the [Bureau of Labor Statistics]. They are trained economists.""
<p>AOL Jobs spoke today to one of those economists at the BLS, John Mullins, about the process behind putting together the reports.</p>
</blockquote>
Hahah, sure, you mean the process whereby Joe Biden picks up the phone and says, ""Look, Mullins, do you really want to see how long you'll last in a Romney administration? I'm hearing he wants to make Steve King his labor secretary. Not the guy who wrote 'Carrie,' you dope! The fucknut from Iowa!""<br />
<blockquote>Q. How are jobs reports compiled?
<p>A. The data is drawn is from the current population survey and the current employment statistical survey. The first is a survey of households. The second, which I work on, is of business establishments, agencies. And data from both appears in the employment situation report each month, which is where we see the unemployment rate.</p>
</blockquote>
Oh yeah, <i>Demoncrat</i> households, I'll bet?where they've gotten instructions from Obama to lie about their jobs!<br />
<blockquote>Q. What do you ask them?
<p>A. For the current employment survey, we get information on payroll, employment size, hours on the job and total earnings. So it's a sample of stats from businesses that pay unemployment insurance. We ask a subset of that universe to participate.</p>
</blockquote>
Yeah, but do you ask who they're VOTING for? Of course not?why bother? You're only calling Demoncrat homes, anyway!<br />
<blockquote>Q. How is the data delivered?
<p>A. The businesses submit the data in a variety of methods, either electronically or over the phone.</p>
</blockquote>
Like we can trust any of that! Steve Jobs was a Demoncrat, after all! I'm sure he rigged his computers to say whatever his boss, Barry Hussein Soetoro, told him to. I mean, you've seen the new maps on the iPhone 6, right? It's all made up!<br />
<blockquote>Q. So there is human involvement?
<p>A. Yes. And then the data is assessed by a computer program that identifies peculiarities, which we review for accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
Demoncrat humans. Next.<br />
<blockquote>Q. Is there any chance for the data to be doctored?
<p>A. No. And we are not political appointees. In my program, there are 15 economists. I have been here for 15 years, some of my colleagues have been here for longer. We don't really talk politics at work, at least not any more than in any other workplace. I would say I wouldn't even really know which way my colleagues lean politically.</p>
</blockquote>
Why would you need to talk politics when you already know what all your other groupthink hivemind DUMMOCRAT liberal colleagues already think? You all take your orders from Lenin, anyway!<br />
<blockquote>Q. Are there any measures taken to make sure the numbers aren't doctored?
<p>A. The data are reviewed by supervisory staff to make sure the analysis is based on sound statistical data. Any one person doesn't have influence great enough to change the numbers significantly. And over the course of the year, it's cross-checked with state unemployment data, which would reveal any inaccuracies. Our methodology is known to prominent statistical organizations and it is transparent and consistent with standard statistical practices.</p>
<p>The process is open and transparent, and all the information is on our website. Anyone who understands the process and statistics knows how preposterous the charge of doctoring is. And I will add that we're all professionals, and we take pride in this not being political.</p>
</blockquote>
Look, seriously, you guys are protesting too much. We know you make the numbers say whatever you want them to say, and you want them to say whatever's good for Obama and the Demoncrats. But the joke's on you, because you guys are total morons. Why did you wait to start now? You should have been making the numbers look better for the past four years!

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">When is the winner not the winner?</div>
</div>
So how bad has President Barack Obama suffered as a result of his sub-par first debate? The tracking polls are certainly not giving anyone reason to panic. That is, unless you are a Republican:
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
<p>Note that these Ipsos numbers are from their tracking poll, not the <a href=""http://kos.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140220/-Romney-gains-after-debate-with-Republicans-Obama-with-independents"">post-debate poll</a> they ran yesterday showing the race going from Obama 48-39 pre-debate to Obama 48-43 post-debate. Those were one-day samples, not the rolling sample here.</p>
<p>Remember, the Ipsos rolling sample is five days long, Rasmussen's is three days, and Gallup is seven days. So the post-debate sample is just <s>1/5th</s> 2/5th (see update), 1/3rd and 1/7th of those numbers, respectively. But had Obama tanked the day after the debate, there would be some slippage in the tracking poll toplines, not <i>improvement</i> for Obama. So if Romney saw any bump in his Thursday polling, it was offset by even better Obama polling before the debate.</p>
<p>One thing is true?oftentimes it takes several days to a week for a big campaign event to be reflected in the polls, as news junkies disseminate the information at water coolers and backyard picnics across the country. That is particularly the case in tracking polls with rolling samples, so we need to keep watching over the weekend to see if any latent damage starts showing up.</p>
<p>However, Republicans don't seem to be winning the post-debate spin, not when the ""moment"" that came out of the debate wasn't anything Obama said, but the fact that Mitt Romney wants to fire Big Bird.</p>
<p>Indeed, it wasn't the Romney campaign who is turning debate moments into television attack ads and internet memes.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: A new Ipsos/Reuters poll has been released, and I updated the chart above accordingly (the previous one had Obama +1). So Obama has held stead and Romney has gained +3. FYI, the new Ipsos numbers include data collected today, so it now has two days of post-debate responses.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Soon-to-be New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich.</div>
</div>
Here's the latest Senate battleground snapshot, using the <a href=""http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/"">TPM polltracker</a> polling composite:
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong> is not included, as Republicans will easily pick up that (vaguely) Democratic seat. The ""Dem"" number above for Maine is actually independent Angus King, since he has become the de facto Democrat in the race.</p>
<p>If the election ended today, and those poll numbers held, Democrats would lose just that Nebraska seat and pick up Arizona, Indiana, Maine, and Massachusetts, for a +3 net gain and a 56-44 Senate. Given that we entered this cycle expecting to barely hold the Senate, that this is a possibility is amazing.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the matter of the undecided voters in these polls, and in Senate races they tend to swing in the direction of the state's dominant political party. That's why I never worried about Elizabeth Warren in <strong>Massachusetts</strong>?as long as she had the resources to compete against Scott Brown, the state's heavily Democratic voters would likely swing in her direction (and they have been). <strong>Maine</strong> is complicated, but still, the only time Republicans win is when the state's significant independent and Democratic wings split the vote evenly. Right now, the Democrat in the race is a sideshow with much of the state's left-of-center support coalescing around King.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong> should technically look good, and it still might, but things are complicated by bullshit ethics issues that have dogged Democrat Shelley Berkley's campaign. She'll outperform the polls on election day because of the Obama machine, but she needs to stay close to appointed Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller. <strong>Connecticut's</strong> liberal leanings will close the deal for our candidate, as should Wisconsin's.</p>
<p>So what about Arizona, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota? Those are all red states in which our candidate is currently leading, but below 50 percent. Yeah, those are the tough ones.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>'s partisan leanings would clearly give Republican Jeff Flake the advantage, yet he's failing to keep pace with the top of his ticket. I still give him the edge, but Richard Carmona is certainly coming on strong and has a legit chance of pulling it off, particularly if Latinos turn out. Heck, some polling is showing the race competitive at the presidential level which would obviously make Cardona's task easier if true.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong> remains the most likely to stay Red in this list. While Democrat Joe Donnelly has a narrow lead, and while Republican Richard Mourdock is embarrassingly below 40 percent, it'll be easier for the Republican to break 50 percent in a state that Obama isn't contesting this year. Still, regardless of how conservative the state might be, Mourdock's anemic numbers show that he's a poor fit for the state. It shouldn't even be competitive, so it's wonderful seeing Republicans dump money into a state that would've been a default hold if the teabaggers hadn't ousted Sen. Dick Lugar in their primary.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong> should be a tough hold in this open-seat race, but Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is hovering just below the 50 percent mark in a state small enough where retail politics matters. And she's good at the retail politics.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Montana</strong> is a real dogfight with two statewide-elected members of Congress?Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and Republican Rep. Danny Rehberg, who represents the state's sole House seat. While Obama isn't contesting the state (he lost it by just 49-47 in 2008), it's more purplish than true Red, and Democrats are competitive at all levels of government. So while Rehberg should get a slight partisan advantage, the fact that he is a well-known <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/02/02/rehberg_montana_senate/"">drunk</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J2JjIPWsx8"">asshole</a> could do him in. Still, expect this to be the last Senate race called on Election Night. Just like in 2006.</p>
<p>If I had to guess today, I'd say the Dems end up losing that single seat in Nebraska, while picking up Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada for a net gain of two seats. But the picture is definitely in flux.</p>
<p>Finally, let's play the ""how many candidates break 45 percent"" game. For Republicans, it's two of 17. For Democrats, it's 12 of 17. Just like Romney, their Senate candidates are finding it really difficult to get out of the mid-40s.</p>
<p>The big mystery: why aren't we seeing similar GOP difficulties in the House? What makes the GOP brand so toxic at the presidential and Senate levels, but not in the battle for the House? Gerrymandering is the obvious answer, but that wouldn't explain the slight Democratic edge in the generic congressional ballot polling. I'm perplexed.</p>

<blockquote>President Obama's campaign set a monthly record for the 2012 cycle in September, hauling in more than $150 million, according to the Wall Street Journal:
<p>The September total far surpasses the $114 million raised in August, when the Obama team snapped a three-month streak in which it was outraised by Republican challenger Mitt Romney. At the time, the $114 million was the most the Obama campaign had collected in any one month in the 2012 election season. The most the Romney campaign has collected so far was $111 million in August.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Just because it's <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/ron-paul-suggests-hell-vote-for-gary-johnson"">funny</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In a Fox Business interview Wednesday, Rep. Ron Paul refused to say who he was planning on voting for ? but ruled out voting for Mitt Romney or President Obama, leaving only one plausible option.
<p>""I obviously haven't announced in support for Romney, so that means that's very unlikely,"" Paul said. ""And I don't think anybody think's I'm going to vote for Obama. So it's back to that frustration level in not seeing a dramatic choice in how the system works.""</p>

<blockquote>Jim Lehrer has been widely criticized for his passive performance as the moderator of Wednesday?s night?s presidential debate, but in his first post-debate interview, he tells POLITICO that he was simply fulfilling his new mission, which was to allow the candidates to engage one another without interruption.
<p>?Based on what the goal was, I saw it as successful,? Lehrer told POLITICO. ?I?ve always said this and finally I had a chance to demonstrate it: The moderator should be seen little and heard even less. It is up to the candidates to ask the follow-up questions and challenge one another.?</p>
<p>?I don?t consider that being passive, I consider it being effective,? he said.</p>

<blockquote>Star Jones, of all people. I mean, I haven?t thought about Star Jones in I don?t know how long, I was unaware she was even on TV still. But she apparently shows up on a morning show? and all of a sudden out of the blue, Star Jones said after I sent this email [coming out], Star Jones said that this was a ratings ploy by me to boost ratings.
<p>That?s why it?s so annoying. Of all the ways to boost ratings, like, if I was wanting to boost ratings, I?d have waited to announce it on a ?very special episode,? that would have been promo?d for weeks and weeks, and there would have been commercials, ?Andersons HUGE announcement!?, and you would have a cutaway of the audience going ?oh!? [covers his mouth in shock].</p>
<p>But instead, I was in Africa on an assignment for 60 Minutes. I sent an email to a friend of mine who put it on a Web site. I gave no interviews about it. I never talked about it. I wasn?t even on the air for days afterward.</p>
