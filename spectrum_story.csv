<p>Physician, heal thyself. </p>
<p>When host David Gregory brings up Jack Welch's completely unsubstantiated assertion that ""Chicago politicians"" had finagled the job numbers somehow to drop the unemployment rate to below 8% just a month before the election, he immediately goes to Republican Newt Gingrich for validation.  And of course, the Newtster is happy to oblige, acknowledging that it is ""plausible"" that the numbers have been fudged, evidence be damned.

We have corroded?what we?re doing, we are corroding trust in our government in our way.  And one-time responsible people are doing to control it.  And the idea that Donald Trump, Jack Welch, rich people with crazy conspiracies, can get traction on this is a bad trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chuckie bubbeleh, you want to know why people like Donald Trump and Jack Welch get traction?  Look in the damn mirror.  </p>
<p>Being a <a href=""http://www.policymic.com/articles/3355/why-government-can-t-be-run-like-a-business"">successful CEO does not give you special insight into the greater economy, or how to govern around it</a>.  They're different beasts entirely.  But you and your mainstream media colleagues continue to disinform your viewership by playing these ""both sides do it"" false equivalencies and never, ever coming down on lies told by your interviewees.  There's no consequence to Jack Welch throwing that wildly bizarre statement out; you'll interview him again when the next jobs report comes out.  </p>
<p>By all rights, people like <a href=""http://www.newshounds.us/trump_wants_romney_to_go_birther_in_the_debate_10032012"">Donald Trump</a>, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/jack-welch-white-house_n_1946903.html"">Jack Welch</a>, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/07/30/newt_gingrich_on_the_great_muslim_brotherhood_conspiracy_i_think_it_s_fair_to_ask_.html"">Newt Gingrich</a>, <a href=""http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/coulter-claims-only-liberal-media-ar"">Ann Coulter</a> and <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/how-sarah-palins-latest-media-conspiracy-theory-harms-the-right/251106/"">Sarah Palin</a> have forfeited their rights of being taken credibly as a talking head for being so monstrously and crazily wrong. Repeatedly. But they never lose their seats at the table. And people who have spoken forcefully and with facts on their side rarely, if ever, get a chance to voice them.  </p>
<p>That's on you.  There's a reason why we no longer trust our pillar institutions--including the news media--because <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/01/1115636/-Diary-of-a-Beltway-Factotum-Wonks-and-Wieners"">you've decided to be buddies inside the Beltway</a>.  Your cocktail parties and barbeques are more important than holding people in power accountable.  So if these ""once responsible"" people are making you crazy, all I can tell you is ""Heal thyself"" and stop giving them credibility.</p>

<p>Republican strategist Mary Matalin on Sunday attempted to lecture Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, saying he had ""lied"" by claiming Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan's wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher system.</p>
<p>During panel discussion on ABC's <em>This Week</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> columnist Peggy Noonan asserted that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had held himself during last week's debate by appearing to be ""a completely moderate, centrist figure.""</p>
<p>""Except that everything he used to claim his centrism wasn't true,"" Krugman pointed out. ""So, this is a question. Does that start to take its toll over the next few months... When you say my plan covers pre-existing conditions when it doesn't and when your own campaign has admitted in the past that it doesn't, what do you say? That's amazing.""</p>
<p>""You have mischaracterized and you have lied about every position and every particular of the Ryan plan on Medicare,"" Matalin interrupted, ""from the efficiency of the Medicare administration to calling it a voucher plan.""</p>
<p>""It is a voucher plan,"" Krugman replied.</p>
<p>""You are hardly credible on calling somebody else a liar,"" Matalin quipped. </p>
<p>Krugman quickly returned to Romney's claim during the debate, that his health care plan covered pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>""I just think that pre-existing thing was a defining moment,"" he observed. ""It was saying this guy believes -- not only did he say something that isn't true, but something that his own campaign has admitted isn't true. And he can say it in front of 70 million people. That's amazing.""</p>
<p>As Think Progress <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/10/07/972441/mary-matalin-calls-paul-krugman-a-liar-for-telling-the-truth/"">noted</a>, Ryan himself has <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/paul-ryan-didnt-always-shy-away-from-the-word-vo"">described his plan</a> as ""converting Medicare into defined contribution sort of voucher system.""</p>

There are a lot of words you could use for this panel segment, most of which I can't use here because we like to keep the site safe for work, but ""great"" isn't one of them.</p>

She ran up against both Krugman and ABC's Johnathan Karl calling her out for her nonsense, but when Karl brought up the fact that he set a record for the number of vetoes, she just shrugged it off.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid any reality is allowed to be acknowledged if it gets in the way of their talking points.</p>

<p>Transcript below the fold of Noonan doing her best to get the Etch-a-Sketch out for Mitt Romney and his debate performance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOONAN:  I think one of the key things about the debate is it's changed -- we will look back on it as an historic moment in this election.  It upended things.  This is what it upended.  Barack Obama was supposed to be the sort of moderate centrist fellow, who looked at Mitt Romney, this extreme, strange fellow.  By the time that debate was over, Mitt Romney seemed a completely moderate, centrist figure, who showed up as Mitt Romney the governor, not as Mitt Romney the candidate.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>KRUGMAN:  Except that everything he used to claim his centrism wasn't true, so this is a question, does that start to take its toll over the next few months. </strong></p>
<p>(CROSSTALK) </p>
<p>NOONAN:  I just think that is unjust.  I mean, to say the very least -- </p>
<p>(CROSSTALK) </p>
<p>KRUGMAN:  When you say my covers pre-existing conditions when it doesn't and when your own campaign has admitted in the past that it doesn't, what do you say?  That's amazing. </p>
<p>MATALIN:  You have Mitt characterized -- and you have lied about every position and every particular of the Ryan plan on Medicare from the efficiency of Medicare administration to calling it a voucher plan, so you're hardly... </p>
<p>KRUGMAN:  It is a voucher plan. </p>
<p>MATALIN:  You are hardly credible on calling somebody else a liar.  Here's what else... </p>
<p><strong>KRUGMAN:  Well, if you're going to make this not about that -- but, no, the fact of the matter, I just think that pre-existing condition thing was a defining moment.  It was saying this guy believes not only he can say something that isn't true, but something that his own complain has admitted isn't true.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And he can say it in front of 70 million people.  That's amazing. </strong></p>
<p>MATALIN:  The other thing this upended was Governor Romney effectively shut down the legions of strawmen that the Obama campaign has erected against him and Mitt Romney, the real Mitt Romney is, what was belied all the stereotypes and demonic mischaracterizations of him, these $300 million of attack ads. </p>
<p>So people got to see, as Ed said, the real Mitt Romney and they liked his positions.  They support all those positions.  And they like him as a person, which is what he needed to do at the convention and the debate. </p>
<p><strong>NOONAN:  And also Mitt Romney also nailed the president on not working well with the other party and made the point that he can work well with the other party as he did in Massachusetts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>KARL:  Yeah, he set the record for vetoes in Massachusetts. </strong></p>
<p>(CROSSTALK) </p>
<p><strong>NOONAN: If you have an 87 percent Democratic legislature you've got to veto a few things.</strong></p></blockquote>

 H/t David for video.</p>
<p>God, Mary Matalin is such an old, bitter, sourpuss, isn't she? Look at how angry she gets when Paul Krugman contradicts her on the facts. Guess it must really suck being the one with no credibility!</p>
<blockquote><p>STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you brought up the trend over the last year, and I want to come to you in a second, Jon. But first, let's put up this chart we have showing that trend across several presidencies of the last year of an incumbent running for president, and it does show, Mary Matalin, that President Obama's improvement in the unemployment rate in an election year is in the green zone, in the zone where presidents get re-elected.</p>
<p>MATALIN: Here is the real world, as Peggy alluded to. <strong>Real median incomes have fallen twice as much under the Obama recovery as they did in the Bush recession. At this point in time, under Ronald Reagan's policies, which Governor Reagan has a 21st century application of, growth and jobs were growing at five times the rate they are.</strong></p>
<p>Let's just look at last year. The states where 17 governors, Republican governors instituted conservative reforms, those states are growing their economy and creating jobs at twice the rate the national one. This is about policies. We know they've worked. There is no recovery in the history of any recessions or depressions that have been as slow and as poor as this one and the revisions upwards --</p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p>MATALIN: <strong>Yes, it is, Dr. Krugman. It's completely, totally true.</strong></p>
<p>KRUGMAN:<strong> I'm sorry, but it just isn't true.</strong></p>
<p>MATALIN: <strong>I don't make up numbers.</strong></p>
<p>KRUGMAN: <strong>Well, but just look at them, then. Because the fact of the matter is, this is actually a fairly typical slow post-financial crisis recovery, which is picking up speed. So although it's terrible -- and I've been bitterly critical of policymakers in general for not doing more -- the fact of the matter is we are clearly now in the upswing, where you can see the beginnings of a turnaround.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>""Gov. Romney had a masterful, theatrical performance just this last week, but the underpinnings and foundation of that performance were fundamentally dishonest,"" Gibbs told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""You cannot cut taxes by $5 trillion as he's doing and simply say, 'Oh, I don't have that tax cut, I'm not going to cut taxes for the wealthy,' when the average high-income earner is going to get a $250,000 tax cut.""</p>
<p>Stephanopolous pointed out that the Romney campaign has asserted that President Barack Obama's campaign had been lying about the $5 trillion tax cut.</p>
<p>""Absolutely not,"" Gibbs insisted. ""If you're going to reduce the Bush tax rates by 20 percent and the estate tax and the [alternative minimum tax], change the corporate rate and whole host of other changes, that adds up in a reduction of revenue of $4.8 trillion. The question for Gov. Romney is, what loopholes are you going to close -- supposedly -- to make up for that revenue?""</p>
<p>""Let's be clear, [Republican vice presidential nominee] Paul Ryan a week ago was asked about the math for this, and Paul Ryan said, 'Look, the math takes to long,'"" he continued. ""Well, Mitt Romney's solution is he just decided there isn't math involved in this problem. And that's absolutely crazy.""</p>
<p>""The only thing that he outlined that he would cut in the budget is Big Bird. You know, he's taken the battle straight to Sesame Street and let Wall Street run hog wild. Again, it was a masterful, theatrical performance. It was fundamentally dishonest for the American people.""</p>

<p>""I don?t have a $5 trillion tax cut,"" Romney had said on Wednesday. ""I don?t have a tax cut of a scale that you?re talking about.""</p>
<p>""Both sides since the debate have been saying that the other candidate is lying about his position,"" Wallace told Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) on Sunday. ""The president keeps saying that Mitt Romney is proposing a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not true.""</p>
<p>""Wait a minute here,"" O'Malley replied. ""Former Gov. Romney is proposing a 20 percent cut to income taxes, including income taxes for the wealthiest Americans. And I believe a 30 percent cut for corporate income taxes, including for people like big oil that are socking all of us at the pump right now. Any economist can debate whether that adds up to $4.9 trillion or does it add up to $5 trillion? But the fact of the matter is in this debate, we saw Big Bird meet the big lie.""</p>
<p>Wallace argued that O'Malley was ""mischaracterizing"" Romney's plan because the former Massachusetts governor had promised to make the tax cuts revenue neutral by closing loopholes, although he has refused to say which loopholes.</p>
<p>""Gov. Romney has not said what he secret plan is for paying for these $5 trillion tax cuts,"" O'Malley explained. ""Just like he won't talk about what his tax returns have been or how much money he's sheltering offshore.""</p>
<p>An <a href=""http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/upload/Romney-Tax-Plan_March-1-2.pdf"">analysis</a> by the the non-partisan Tax Policy Center concluded that Romney's plan would reduce revenue by $480 billion in 2015 and $5 trillion over 10 years.</p>

<p>For all the Monday-morning quarterbacking on the debates, the one thing that didn't get discussed in the mainstream media is what didn't get discussed.  Like issues that matter to Americans.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the economy matters to Americans.  But Solyndra and Dodd Frank affect Americans far less than <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/legalize-marijuana-56-percent-rasmussen-poll_n_1537706.html"">decriminalizing marijuana</a> and<a href=""http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=35793&amp;news_iv_ctrl=0&amp;abbr=daily4_""> women's reproductive health issues</a>, both of which directly affect how people involved can contribute to the economy.  And both of those topics were completely ignored, among many others, like <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/aurora-survivor-frustrated-gun-talk-debate-article-1.1175056"">gun control</a>, our <a href=""http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2012/10/some-questions-a-sentencing-fan-might-ask-during-the-upcoming-presidential-debates.html"">criminal justice system</a> and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/teach-plus/education-presidential-debates-_b_1940024.html"">education</a>. </p>
<p>But not on Up with Chris Hayes, where Rep. Peter Welch bemoans a DC culture that prevents serious adult discussions about issues that directly affect Americans in lieu of talking points.  And that is a bipartisan issue.  It's exactly the reason that these debates are useless as an exercise or political tool, as this <a href=""http://www.app.com/article/20121007/NJOPINION02/310070030/End-parties-control-presidential-debates?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Opinion|s&amp;nclick_check=1"">LTE points out aptly</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In 1987, the Republican and Democratic parties took over the presidential debates from the League of Women Voters, excluding all  other candidates and many topics of discussion. The two parties? debate  commission is corporate-sponsored, and the moderators? questions  corporate-friendly, despite the face of 40-year presidential debate  moderator,  Jim Lehrer. We need to hear from all candidates and not just  those who have promised big pharma, big oil and big defense lots of  cash and big prizes for their support, something that both Democratic  and Republican hopefuls do.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the popular, super-majority positions that will not be talked about in our debates:</p>
<p>?  Shifting billions of dollars from war preparation to education, infrastructure, green energy.</p>
<p>?  Raising taxes on the super wealthy and corporations.</p>
<p>?  Prosecuting U.S. war crimes.</p>
<p>?  Ending warrantless spying, drone wars and assassinations.</p>
<p>?  Breaking up media monopolies and undoing corporate trade agreements.</p>
<p>?  Expanding Medicare to everyone.</p>
<p>?  The drug war and criminal justice.I  am sure there are more never-debated positions that are breaking this  country apart. Tell the major parties and the debate commission to get  real and make the debate process one of inclusion.</p></blockquote>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of all the leaders who have called Lexington, Virginia their home, none is more distinguished than George Marshall?the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then plan Europe?s rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">General Marshall once said, ?The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.?  Those words were true in his time?and they still echo in ours.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">*** </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts.  They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East?a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century.  And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of the same forces that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration?s attempts to convince us of that for so long.  No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.  </p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">***</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope.  But hope is not a strategy.  We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.  ?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">? It is time to change course in the Middle East.  ?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf the region?and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination.  For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions?not just words?that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. ?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">? I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world.  The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years.  I will reverse that failure.  I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Libya, I will support the Libyan people?s efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.   </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Egypt, I will use our influence?including clear conditions on our aid?to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad?s tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them.  We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran?rather than sitting on the sidelines.  It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.  President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war ? and to potential attacks here at home ? is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11.  I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.  On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">***</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I believe that if America does not lead, others will?others who do not share our interests and our values?and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us.  America?s security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years.  I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America?s great influence?wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively?to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better?not perfect, but better. </p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"">*** </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall:  ?He ? always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.?  That is the role our friends want America to play again.  And it is the role we must play. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.</p>"

<p>On Friday, October 5, according to the White House, Biden spent the day working. In the morning, he was scheduled to attend the presidential daily briefing in the Oval Office, with President Obama. That afternoon Biden was to ""meet with senior advisors,"" according to the White House.</p>
<p>For this weekend, the White House provided the following guidance: ""The Vice President will be in Wilmington, Delaware. There are no public events scheduled.""</p>
<p>As for the next three days, Biden will remain in Delaware. ""On Monday through Wednesday, the Vice President will be in Wilmington, Delaware. There are no public events scheduled.""</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Rasmussen?s write-up says, ?The generation gap remains wide.  Obama leads by double digits among those under 40.  Romney leads by double digits among those over 40.?  With a spirited performance during his debate next week against Vice President Biden, however, Paul Ryan may be able to make a dent in Obama?s advantage among younger voters ? many of whom are poised to respond to <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/winning-answer_653814.html?nopager=1"">a powerfully delivered anti-Obamacare, anti-debt, pro-growth message</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">About two-thirds of Rasmussen?s latest polling was taken after the presidential debate.  The poll that Rasmussen will release tomorrow morning will be the first taken entirely after the debate and will show whether Romney?s debate bounce was even greater than the 4 points that it looks to be right now.  Rasmussen is the first polling outfit to have released a poll taken mostly after the debate.</p>

But it isn?t. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Although Landry <em>is </em>allied with the Tea Party, Boustany is far from an ?establishment? Republican when it comes to national security issues?and especially to the question of Israel. Boustany?s <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/only-one-can-survive_651383.html"">record on Israel </a>is far outside the mainstream. He's one of only two Republicans to have ever been endorsed by J Street, the left-wing advocacy group that bills itself as ?pro-Israel, pro-peace? (with far more emphasis on the latter than the former). In 2009, he attended J Street?s first annual conference, even after Israeli ambassador Michael Oren boycotted it, citing policies from the organization ?that may impair the interests of Israel.? Boustany eventually severed all connections with the group, after discovering, he says, that ?they were dishonest with me about where their funding came from??namely, the big dollars from billionaire George Soros. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">J Street maintains that Boustany was ?with them from the beginning,? and that the party ?forced? the resignation of this ?very brave? congressman.? ?When he accepted that endorsement he aligned himself with their beliefs,? one pro-Israel activist notes. ?Severing ties with J Street because of where their funding comes from isn?t the same as severing ties because of what they believe.? Noah Pollak, the executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, points out that ""there?s no political benefit to him"" for having aligned himself with J Street, ?so we should take him at his word that this is important to him.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Boustany?s stance on Israel is unlikely to be popular with the voters in the very conservative Third Congressional District, whose Republicans overwhelmingly supported Rick Santorum over Mitt Romney in March, and who now, with a general election pitting two Republican members against each other because of redistricting, have a chance to elect someone whose foreign policy beliefs are more in line with their own. In August, Landry told me, ?I stand by Israel 100 percent.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And they might do just that. As of today, all of the mainstream Republican County (Parish) Committees who have endorsed a candidate for Congress in the member versus member race have abandoned Boustany, even though most have been his constituents for years, and endorsed Jeff Landry. Although Boustany?s got a large fundraising edge, he?s only had to run safe races before, and Landry has been having a very good couple of weeks. He?s been endorsed by the Family Research Council, the Tea Party of Louisiana; Freedom Works, Citizens United, and the Tea Party Nation. Mitt Romney recently named Landry to his ?National Catholic Coalition Committee.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Romney must believe Landry has a chance to win. And it looks like he does. </p>"

The WSJ?s account has clearly angered one of Ahmad?s friends ? Mohammed al Zawahiri, who <a href=""http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/zawahiris-brother-cairo-embassy-assault_652217.html"">helped lead the protest</a> at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo the same day as the attack in Libya. Mohammed al Zawahiri is the younger brother of al Qaeda emir Ayman al Zawahiri.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><a href=""http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/54876/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-Islamist-played-no-role-in-Benghazi-attac.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Ahram Online</em></a> reports today that Mohammed al Zawahiri is ?slamming? the WSJ account. Mohammed al Zawahiri claims that ?the Salafist movement does not commit acts of violence and that Ahmad is innocent.? He adds that the WSJ article is just an attempt to stir up trouble between Salafist groups and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">No one should take Mohammed al Zawahiri at his word. As a commander in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) organization, a core part of the al Qaeda joint venture, he has established a web of nefarious ties that go far beyond his brother. In fact, according to the very same WSJ article Mohammed al Zawahiri objects to, he helped put Ahmad in touch with Ayman al Zawahiri.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">?U.S. officials believe [Mohammed al Zawahiri] has helped Mr. Ahmad connect with the al Qaeda chief,? the WSJ reported.  </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The WSJ explains: ?Western officials say Mr. Ahmad has petitioned the chief of al Qaeda, to whom he has long ties, for permission to launch an al Qaeda affiliate and has secured financing from al Qaeda's Yemeni wing.?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Given that Ahmad?s forces are suspected of taking part in the Benghazi attack, which reportedly involved other al Qaeda parties (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar al Sharia, etc.), it would be a mistake to assume that nothing came of Ahmad?s petition of Ayman al Zawahiri. Not just anyone receives financing from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), as Ahmad reportedly has.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This brings us back to Mohammed al Zawahiri. He denies everything, of course. Mohammed al Zawahiri denies that he has resumed his terrorist career. He also denies having anything to do with the ransacking of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, claiming that he only meant to launch a protest outside the compound?s walls.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">U.S. intelligence officials, judging by the WSJ account and other reporting, clearly don?t believe Mohammed al Zawahiri?s denials. So the question becomes, what (if anything) is Morsi?s government going to do about him and his ilk? </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of course, it was Morsi?s Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government that paved the way for Egyptian Islamic Jihad members and other terrorists to be released from Egypt?s prisons in the first place.  Then there is this, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/10/world/meast/zawahiri-peace-plan/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">from CNN</a>, on September 11 of this year<a name=""_GoBack""></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class=""MsoNormal"">A source with direct knowledge of Egyptian government talks with jihadists in the Sinai says al-Zawahiri is helping negotiations. The source says al-Zawahiri has the respect of the Islamists and the trust of the new government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So while U.S. intelligence officials believe that Mohammed al Zawahiri is helping to put terrorists in touch with the head of al Qaeda, the Egyptian government ?trust(s)? him to help negotiate with terrorists in the Sinai.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It is safe to say there is a major disconnect here. </p>

But the American Enterprise Institute?s Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst, says that although we don?t really know how many undecided voters there are, ?the best bet? is that about 5 percent of voters are undecided?7 percent in the key swing state of Florida. My own guess is that these Hamlets, if indeed they ever resolve their doubts and do vote, are unlikely to be among the early voters, and so just might be influenced by incoming data in the next 30 days.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here are the facts. Total non-farm payrolls rose by 114,000 in September, with 104,000 of the new jobs added in the private sector. Previous estimates for July and August were increased by 86,000, primarily due to an upward revision in the number of government jobs added. Average hourly earnings and weekly hours worked, and the labor force participation rate all ticked up. The headline unemployment rate, computed from a separate survey of households rather than businesses, fell from 8.1 percent in August to 7.8 percent in September, prompting some conspiracy theorists, among them former GE boss Jack Welch, to claim the Labor Department cooked the books to bring the unemployment rate below that prevailing when President Obama took office, just in time for the election. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis says she is ?insulted,? as well she should be.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Now, for the spin. The Obama camp, reeling from their man?s truly dreadful performance in the first debate with Mitt Romney, says the glass is half full and filling up, slowly, but filling nevertheless. The economy Barack Obama inherited was losing 700,000 jobs a month but, thanks to the president?s financial reforms, bail out of the auto industry, stimulus package, and tough treatment of China and other unfair traders, it has added about 5.2 million jobs since the recession ended. Most important, the unemployment rate is now below 8 percent, as the president promised it would be, and that is lower than when the president inherited the economic mess created by his predecessor?s disastrous tax and deregulatory policies. So say the Obama spinners. The president himself jubilantly proclaimed, ?We have come too far to turn back now.? </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Mitt Romney sees the glass as more than half empty, and leaky. The five million jobs added since the end of the recession are only half of those lost since Obama was elected, despite the hugely expensive stimulus that contributed to the addition of over $5 trillion to the national debt, a 50 percent increase in four years. There are still 12.1 million unemployed workers, and 23 million either unemployed, involuntarily on short hours, or too discouraged to look for work, a consequence of the slowest recovery since WWII. Include these workers in the total and the U-6 unemployment rate (to use the technical jargon) remains stuck at 14.7 percent.       </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Perhaps worst of all, some 4.8 million workers have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer?the government?s definition of long-term unemployed?their skills atrophying, their savings (if any) dwindling, and their psyches badly bruised, a job being more than a pay check. This dire situation, claims Romney, is the result of the rising health care costs to be loaded onto employers by Obamacare, the drag on business investment created by the president?s anti-business rhetoric and regulatory spree, and soaring deficits.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Manhattan Institute?s Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the George W. Bush Labor Department, and is no fan of the president, nevertheless characterizes the new report as ?a very, very good employment report,? with hundreds of thousands moving into the labor force, and finding jobs. But she worries about the high U-6 unemployment rate<a name=""_GoBack""></a>. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even if this ?very, very good employment report? is helpful to Obama, it is not good enough to end the weakness in the labor market. That lasting improvement will only come when economic growth picks up, and a lot. Ed Lazear, the Stanford University professor who served as chairman of George W. Bush?s Council of Economic Advisers, sees the report as ?nothing to write home about,? while Austan Goolsbee, the University of Chicago economist who held the same post early in the Obama administration tells us we can ?take some heart? from the new jobs report. But they agree on one thing: The rate of economic growth has to pick up if the jobs market is to recover fully.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The prospects for such an acceleration in growth are not unambiguously bright. Indeed, the economy may well be slowing rather than picking up speed. The growth rate has been declining steadily, from 3.0 percent in the first quarter, to 2.0 percent in the second quarter to 1.3 percent in the third quarter, and some economists expect zero growth or recession in 2013. The year-over-year gain in retail sales in September for the 19 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters was a tiny 0.8 percent, far below the growth in July (4.8 percent), August (6.1 percent), and last September (5.5 percent). Real spending is growing only modestly and incomes are growing more slowly than expected, according to Goldman Sachs. The hot apartment rental market seems to be cooling, with the decline in the vacancy rate in the second quarter the smallest improvement since early 2010. Reis Inc., which follows the property market for its clients, also reports that demand for office space is slowing somewhat. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even more ominous for long-term growth prospects is the decline in world trade, as recession bites in the eurozone and growth slows in China. The World Trade Organization estimates that the global volume of trade in goods will expand only 2.5 percent this year, half the rate in 2011 and far below the 14 percent chalked up in 2010. Not good news for exporters. Oliver Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, now says, ?It will surely take at least a decade from the beginning of the crisis for the world economy to get back to decent shape.? Since the crisis began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, we have about six years of a non-decent world economy ahead of us. And Americans who are comforted by the fact that we are at least eking out some growth while Europe is in recession might heed the warning of Bill Gross of Pimco, which manages $1.8 trillion in its several funds. He says that America?s reliance on debt is like ?an addict whose habit extends beyond weed or cocaine and who frequently pleasures himself with budgetary crystal meth.? He reckons the U.S. must raise taxes or cut spending to the tune of $1.6 trillion per year, compared with the mere $200 billion in spending cuts and tax increases that would occur if America goes over the ?fiscal cliff? at year end. One way or the other, whether we borrow until the bond vigilantes cry halt, or don the hair shirt of austerity, the outlook is not brilliant.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And yet, and yet. Auto sales continue to boom, rising in September by 12.8 percent over last year, hitting a 4½ year high as consumers continue to trade in their ageing vehicles. The manufacturing sector picked up in September for the first time in four months, and passed the 50-point mark that the Institute for Supply Management sets as the point at which a sector is growing. Both new orders and employment in that sector rose. The housing market continues to recover: prices are rising, new-home sales are about 28 percent higher than last year, and shortages of houses for sale are being reported in some regions. Private equity funds are sitting on $1 trillion, looking for deals, and corporations have a $2 trillion cash hoard, waiting for some clarity as to future tax and regulatory policy (the Republican view) or a government-stimulated increase in consumer demand (the Democrats? Keynesian view). Presumably, the clarity businessmen say they seek will come on November 6, when we will learn whether businesses? failure to invest is due to uncertainty or will be exacerbated by a new certainty: The tax increases and new regulations that President Obama is promising should he return to the White House to finish the job he has described as transforming America.</p>"

But Dickerson is ignoring the fact that Romney running mate Paul Ryan suggested last week that Romney would not reduce the size of his tax cuts because lowering taxes is his highest priority.</p>
<p>During a panel discussion on the presidential debate on <em>Face The Nation</em>, Dickerson said that it was unfair to accuse Romney of being dishonest about his tax plan. Dickerson explained that a top Romney economic adviser ""said we have two goals here. One is deficit reduction, the other is reducing marginal rates. If those come in conflict our primary goal is deficit reduction and the marginal rates might not go down as much.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>That stands in direct contrast to remarks by Paul Ryan, who was asked specifically if Mitt Romney would ""scale back on the 20 percent tax cut for the wealthy"" if the cuts could not be paid for and replied ""No, no."".</p>
<p>Chris Wallace asked Ryan in that September 30 <em>Fox News Sunday</em> interview ""what's most important to [Romney] in his tax reform plan?"" Ryan replied, ""keeping tax rates down.

But the statements from President Obama they are pointing to are true.</p>
<p>John Fund of <em>National Review</em> and Jonathan Karl of ABC News both used factual statements made by President Obama as examples to claim that he ""stretched the truth"" during the October 3 presidential debate. Fund cited Obama's comments about the power of an advisory board created by the health care reform law, while Karl pointed to Obama's statement that he has proposed a $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. In fact, both statements by President Obama during the debate were true, and have been supported by independent fact-checkers.</p>
<p>As a guest on CBS' <em>Face the Nation </em>Fund claimed ""both candidates, I think, told things that stretched the truth."" Fund specifically criticized Obama for saying in the debate that the Independent Payments Advisory Board instituted by the health reform law ""wasn't going to make any decisions on treatment."" According to Fund, that board ""has unilateral power, unless Congress overrides it with a supermajority, to basically tell all doctors and hospitals this is how much money you have to treat people. That is incredible power. That is effectively the power to ration health care. So I think the President was stretching the truth in a big part of Obamacare.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the <a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=9D86F64C-E1F6-5113-51036B3743BD9466"">debate</a>, President Obama disputed Mitt Romney's statement that the health reform law ""put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive."" Obama described the advisory board as ""a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera"" who work ""to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? ... [W]hat this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.""</p>
<p>Obama's description is accurate. The <a href=""http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3590/text"">health reform law</a> forbids the board from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care ... or otherwise restrict benefits,"" and <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/04/if-the-right-wing-media-are-right-romney-is-in/190345"">multiple fact-checkers</a> have made clear the board ""wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans"" and ""cannot by law make recommendations about what treatments people get."" Instead, according to <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-ipab-board-can-tell-people-ultimately-/"">Politifact</a>, ""it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost.""</p><div class=""feedflare"">

Economists, however, agree that these&nbsp;attacks are&nbsp;baseless&nbsp;and that&nbsp;data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics&nbsp;is accurate.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;guest-hosting&nbsp;Fox News'&nbsp;<em>Your World</em>,&nbsp;Bolling&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;the BLS,&nbsp;which&nbsp;reported this morning&nbsp;that the unemployment rate&nbsp;has&nbsp;dropped from 8.2&nbsp;percent&nbsp;to 7.8&nbsp;percent. Bolling&nbsp;-- whose guest, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, also questioned the BLS data -- cast doubt on&nbsp;the report by repeatedly claiming the numbers&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;""feel right.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>Bolling went on <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/05/conservative-media-add-obama-donations-to-their/190420"">suggest bias</a> in the BLS by highlighting two employees ""who both have been donors to the Obama campaign"" and asking if we should ""make any assumptions on that."" Welch responded by calling the&nbsp;Labor&nbsp;Department ""ideologues"" and claiming they ""bankrupted the auto industry"" and ""handed the companies over to the unions.""</p>
<p>Later in the segment, Welch said it was a ""coincidence"" that ""one month before the election, we have a number that comes out one-tenth below when the president took office,"" suggesting it came&nbsp;from&nbsp;""an ideologue division of the federal government."" Bolling replied:&nbsp;""I don't believe in coincidence.""</p>
<p>Economic experts, however, have dismissed the type of conspiracy&nbsp;peddling that Bolling engaged in today. In an&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;Salon, economist Justin Wolfers&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/10/05/an_economist_debunks_the_job_truthers/"">pushed back</a>&nbsp;on the attacks:</p><div class=""feedflare"">

But one of the economists Fox identified is no longer a BLS employee, and only a tiny fraction of BLS workers have even made campaign donations.</p>
<p>This morning, BLS released the September <a href=""http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"">jobs report</a> showing that the unemployment rate has dropped to 7.8 percent. It was the <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2012/1005/Jobless-rate-falls-below-8-percent-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-four-years"">first time in nearly four years</a> that the rate has fallen below 8 percent. Media conservatives -- who have a <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/05/phony-conspiracy-conservative-medias-history-of/190383"">history</a> of attempting to negate positive jobs data -- <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/video/2012/10/05/foxs-charles-payne-declares-the-drop-in-the-une/190391"">rushed</a> to <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/05/media-dismiss-drop-in-unemployment-rate-as-gove/190392"">discredit</a> the data, claiming the jobs numbers were ""total pro-Obama propaganda.""</p>
<p>During a segment in which he stressed that Fox News had done its ""homework,"" <em>Your World</em> guest host Eric Bolling named two economists he said work for BLS currently ""who've both been donors to the Obama campaign,"" asking, ""Should I make any assumptions from that?""</p>

Four days on, they are still, and apparently on purpose, sustaining the &ldquo;Romney won big&rdquo; story by furiously making excuses for Obama&rsquo;s poor performance. He didn&rsquo;t do <em>that </em>badly, but listening to Obama himself, his campaign, and his bewildered surrogates the last few days&nbsp;you would think that Obama was utterly destroyed by some kind of evil genius who was equal parts master actor, pathological liar, and bully. You should watch the debate again to see how silly this is. And it&rsquo;s hard to understand why the Democrats continue to advance this story. I bet that if you polled people today about who won and lost the debate, Obama would do even worse than he did in Wednesday night&rsquo;s instant polls, thanks to his and his campaign&rsquo;s continuing self flagellation.</p>

	<p>To listen to some German businessmen singing the praises of the euro, you could be forgiven for thinking that life must have been hell beforehand. In fact, it was just the opposite. It was under the deutschemark that Germany achieved its &#8220;economic miracle&#8221;. True, there was a persistent tendency for the deutschemark to rise. But Germany still tended to run a current account surplus, albeit smaller than today &ndash; less than 1pc of GDP, on average, between 1970 and 1998.

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever heard the term &ldquo;disruptive physician&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why no, I haven't. Please go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; means doing things that would get you fired on the spot if you were a less exalted person than an M.D....When analysts began looking closely at negative patient outcomes, we were all astonished to learn that disruptive physicians were firmly linked to morbidity and mortality.  Put in simplest terms, if Dr. Frankenstein has a habit of verbally abusing the ICU nurse who calls him in the middle of the night about a patient who is not doing well, sooner or later that nurse&rsquo;s subconscious causes her to start taking a more rosy view of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.  Dr. Frankenstein arrives fresh and rested in the morning, but the patient lost too much ground over the night, and oops! there you have it, a negative patient outcome, also called &ldquo;death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how the problem was addressed.  Malpractice insurance underwriters and accrediting bodies require hospitals to have disruptive physician policies that clearly define the prohibited behavior, and to train all staff &ndash; right down to the parking-lot attendants &ndash; every year about what the policy says.  What makes it work is the mandatory-snitch rule.  If said parking lot attendant happens to witness a physician in violation of the policy, the incident must be reported or the attendant&rsquo;s job is on the line.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous: threaten to fire the victims of an abusive bastard if they are too intimidated to stand up for themselves?  But on closer inspection it functions exactly as a good policy should....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heussler suggests that hundreds of people might be unfairly behind bars in Massachusetts because of faked drug tests that would have been prevented with a mandatory snitch rule. If, like me, you've never heard of this before, the whole thing is worth a read.</p>"

As usual in a presidential cycle, there are three categories this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_crystal_ball.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px 20px 15px 30px;"" />Winner and total electoral votes for president.</li>

    <li>Composition of the Senate.  Current composition is 53 D/I, 47 R.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year, instead of giving my own projections, I decided to provide an official line as forecast by Sam Wang, this blog's semi-official election forecaster (and winner of the 2008 election pool). Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://election.princeton.edu/2012/10/05/predictions-october-5th-presidentsenate/"" target=""_blank"">President:</a> Obama 332, Romney 206</li>

</ul>
<p>The links take you to Sam's posts, which include error bars and other details. Can you do better than Sam? His presidential forecast sure seems optimistic to me.

<blockquote>
<p>Steep drop in jobless rate has some Obama foes crying foul</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I thought: this is amazing. One tweet from Jack Welch sets off a wingnut firestorm that actually makes the front page of the <em>Times</em>. The power of these guys to set the news agenda is pretty spectacular.</p>
<p>But there may be an unappreciated irony at work here. Although BLS didn't cook the unemployment books, there's no question that the headline number, which is derived from a telephone survey of households, can be fairly noisy from month to month. There was a big spike upward in September's employment figure, and that could be real or it could be a statistical outlier.</p>
<p>Or there might be a third option: In a little-noticed part of yesterday's report, BLS announced that it had <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"" target=""_blank"">systematically undercounted jobs</a> by 386,000 from April 2011 through March 2012. So maybe it's continued to undercount jobs since then, as Karl Smith suggests <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2012/10/05/yeah-so-about-those-400000-jobs/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. If so, then not only is the September number accurate, it's making up for an undercount over the past six months. That's the shaded portion under the red line in the chart below, which is a simple trend line that runs through the revised March 2012 figure and extends it through September. It suggests that the September employment number is right where you'd expect it to be if the economy were continuing a steady but modest recovery&nbsp;&mdash; which seems like a reasonable bet.</p>
<p>So here's the irony: if BLS really has been undercounting, it means that the jobs picture has looked overly gloomy during the first half of the year, <em>which is exactly when it hurt President Obama the worst</em>. What this means is that the wingnuts might be more than merely wrong. They might have things 180 degrees backward. It's quite possible that far from being unfairly favorable toward Obama, the BLS numbers have been unfairly hurting him. September's spike corrected that, but probably too late to do him very much good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama's campaign and Democratic allies raised a record $181 million in September, his campaign manager said today....The Obama campaign manager said the average donation was $53, with 98% of the contributions at $250 or less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, I wonder if the Republican focus on Super PACs will end up hurting them? Team Blue might be raising a bit less money overall than Team Red, but the Obama campaign is raising more than the Romney campaign. If you're Karl Rove, I suppose you might argue that Super PACs have more freedom to launch nasty (but effective) attack ads than the campaigns themselves, so it's a good thing that a big chunk of conservative money is going to Crossroads GPS and their ilk. If you're Jim Messina, you'll probably argue that, in the end, it's better to have most of your money under central control, where you can use it precisely the way you need to.</p>
<p>I have no idea which is the better argument. Either way, though, Obama certainly doesn't seem to be having any big problem raising money from the folks who supported him in 2008. I continue to think that Mitt Romney lost a real chance to eat into that support when he decided last spring that he had to continue placating the tea partiers instead of immediately moving to the center.</p>"

<p>The Social Security retirement age is already increasing by statute and will reach 67 in a few years. Apparently Romney wants it to go up to 69 or 70. The actual number he has in mind <a href=""http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security"" target=""_blank"">is unclear</a> (surprise, surprise) but given that he plans to balance Social Security's books <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_life_expectancy_top_bottom.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />solely by raising the retirement age and slowing the growth of benefits for ""those with higher incomes,"" I'd put my money on 70. Slowing benefit growth on high earners just doesn't do enough to let you get away with anything less.</p>
<p>So there you have it. If you're in your 30s or 40s, Mitt Romney thinks you should work until you're 70. That might be OK for bloggers and politicians, but I'm not sure how all the dockworkers and haircutters and grocery clerks are going to feel about that.

<blockquote>
<p>Before it becomes a kind of Fact-Made-Fact-By-Repetition, I'd like to challenge the much-assumed idea that in the first presidential debate Mitt Romney ""moved to the center"" in a real, substantive way. This seems to be the conclusion of many Democrats, many in the MSM, and of those few Republicans who occasionally object to the endless rightward drift of the GOP.</p>
<p>Sure, his rhetoric <em>sounded</em> more moderate. But when you look at the details, nothing changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ed provides chapter and verse in the rest of his post, which is worth a read. But I'd like to add a related thought: relatively speaking, Romney was never all that far to the right in the first place. Sure, he's adopted all the standard positions of the modern tea-party-ized GOP, but during the primaries he was always <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_romney_grimace.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />pretty careful not to go any further than that. On actual policy, he never tried to move to the right of Newt Gingrich or Michele Bachmann or Rick Perry.</p>
<p>What he <em>did</em> do was adopt a ""severely conservative"" rhetorical style, highlighted by his almost comically harsh attacks on Barack Obama. He was content to let the other candidates offer up redder meat than he did, but he always insisted on making sure that everyone knew his contempt for Obama was second to none. At the time, I figured this was deliberate: he didn't want to take any insane positions that might hurt him in the general election, but he still wanted to do something to show tea party voters that he was one of them in his heart. The way he did that was by never letting five minutes go by without launching yet another over-the-top verbal volley against Obama.</p>
<p>And it was a good strategy! It's easy to ditch attacks like that after the primary is over, and for the most part he has. Ever since spring, Romney's schtick has been an almost sorrowful acknowledgment that Obama is a good man, an honorable man, but in over his head. The harshness is mostly gone, and hardly anyone has even noticed that his attacks on Obama changed course rather abruptly as soon as he became the consensus nominee in April. And since then he's also solidified his standing with the tea party base strongly enough that he can get away with some rhetorical concessions on policy as well. This resonates more strongly with the pundit class, but Ed is right: on substance, Romney hasn't changed a thing. He still won't accept a dime in revenue increases; he still plans to cut taxes substantially on the rich while claiming he's doing no such thing; he still wants to voucherize both Medicare and education spending; he still wants to turn Medicaid over to the states and slash its funding; he still wants to increase the defense budget; he still wants to repeal both Obamacare and Dodd-Frank; and he still claims to be a deficit warrior even as he refuses to provide any details about just how he'd actually cut the deficit.</p>
<p>The new, more bipartisan Romney should be taken for what it is: a campaign stratagem, not a real change. He isn't moving to the center, he's just trying to sound like he's moving to the center. My guess is that it won't work, but given the obsession of the Washington press corps with optics and conflict, it might. You never know.</p>"

<p>There's a very sharp, very sudden dropoff in 1994. Just eyeballing it, it looks like there were an average of about 14 attacks per year from 1970-1993 but only six or so from 1994-2010. Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""That follows the trend of terrorism generally,"" says Erin Miller, a research assistant at START who manages the Global Terrorism Database. ""In the early 1990s there's a drop-off worldwide in terrorism against pretty much all target types."" Miller cites the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a subsequent wane in leftist terrorism as one possible explanation for the downturn beginning in the mid-1990s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe! On a broader note, Adam points out that Mitt Romney's tiresome trope about the Benghazi attacks being the result of President Obama's ""weakness"" is just nonsense. There were lots of attacks during the Reagan administration, and many fewer during the Clinton administration. Attacks rose a bit during the Bush administration, and have been a hair lower during the Obama administration. This is almost certainly due to external factors, not to any particular strength or weakness of the presidents themselves.</p>
<p>Still, it's fair to say that the Obama administration has hardly distinguished itself with its curiously meandering response to the Benghazi attacks. I think they've finally given up on the suggestion that it was all because of a YouTube video, but beyond that there's still a fair amount of confusion about who was behind the attack and what the motivation was. Weakness may not have caused the attacks, but until Obama can get his hands around it, it's going to remain a pretty soft spot for the Romney campaign to poke at.</p>"

At the same time, private sector jobs bottomed out at the end of 2009 and have been on a steady upward rise ever since. ""The government sector drag pulls the total down,"" she says, ""which should be appreciated by small-govt loving Republicans."" It should be!

The chart below, which I update monthly, shows net job creation since the beginning of 2008. Those of you with sharp memories will note that the past three months look bluer than they used to. This is because the BLS revised its July and August estimates upward. It's still nothing to write home about, but job creation over the past few months has been a bit healthier than it initially looked.</p>
<p>Politically, this jobs report has something for everyone. The Romney will camp will correctly point out that the recovery remains pretty sluggish. The Obama camp will correctly note that the unemployment rate has now fallen from 9.0% to 7.8% over the past year. The Romney camp will correctly point out that the payroll survey (see chart below) doesn't suggest job creation is really all that robust right now. The Obama camp will simply be happy that the headline unemployment number went down a bunch and the Romney team can no longer chirrup endlessly about ""xx straight months of unemployment above 8%."" You should feel free to adopt your own talking points accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I originally said that the unemployment rate had gone down partly because people were dropping out of the labor force and therefore no longer being counted as unemployed. That was true last month, but not this month. Sorry about that. I've corrected the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wednesday night's debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney underscored a core truth about America's presidential election season: the vast majority of the most consequential policy questions are completely excluded from the process....In part this is because presidential elections are now conducted almost entirely like a tawdry TV reality show....But in larger part, this exclusion is due to the fact that, despite frequent complaints that America is plagued by a lack of bipartisanship, the two major party candidates are in full-scale agreement on many of the nation's most pressing political issues. As a result these are virtually ignored, drowned out by a handful of disputes that the parties relentlessly exploit to <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_debate_lehrer_2012_10_03.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />galvanise their support base and heighten fear of the other side.</p>
<p>Most of what matters in American political life is nowhere to be found in its national election debates. Penal policies vividly illustrate this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Damn. Even Glenn is talking about the debate. He thinks that allowing third-party candidates to participate would ""highlight just how similar Democrats and Republicans have become, and what little choice American voters actually have on many of the most consequential policies."" Maybe. But keep in mind that the topics of last night's debate were chosen in advance by Jim Lehrer. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Economy &ndash; I</li>
    <li>The Economy &ndash; II</li>
    <li>The Economy &ndash; III</li>
    <li>Health Care</li>
    <li>The Role of Government</li>
    <li>Governing</li>
</ul>
<p>Penal policy wasn't there, so it wouldn't really matter much if Gary Johnson had been on the stage. The problem here was the moderator, not the two-party system.</p>
<p>However, there will be a stronger case for a third-party presence in the next debate, which includes foreign policy topics. Even if Candy Crowley sticks to the big-ticket topics &mdash; Iran, Afghanistan, China, etc. &mdash; a third-party candidate like Johnson would have genuinely different things to say. At the same time, I wouldn't expect too much from this. Ron Paul participated in all of the Republican primary debates, and he didn't noticeably move the public opinion needle on foreign policy issues. I'm not sure Gary Johnson would either.</p>
<p>Still, maybe he should have a chance to try. So here's a question for the hivemind: what's fair here? The current threshold is that candidates have to score at least 15% in selected polls to be invited to the debates, and this year no one has qualified. <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/155537/little-support-third-party-candidates-2012-election.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Gary Johnson is around 3% nationally</a>. But maybe that's the wrong threshold. I'm violently opposed to a really small threshold, like 1% or so, because it has the potential to turn the debates into a circus. (Well, more of a circus.) The public really does deserve to get a good close look at the two major-party candidates, since one of them is certain to win the election, and having half a dozen true-believing obsessives on stage doesn't help that.</p>
<p>So here's another idea: the debates should always feature three candidates. Two of them would be the major party candidates and the third would be whoever polls the best among all the minor party candidates. If there were literally no minor party candidates who even appeared on enough state ballots to be serious contenders, then maybe we'd be stuck with two debaters after all. Otherwise, though, we'd always make room for at least one more. Maybe the debate commission would commission its own polls, or maybe it would rely on existing polls. Either way, it would publish the ground rules, and a week before the first debate it would announce who the best performing third-party candidate was.</p>
<p>This system has the virtue of ensuring that the non-mainstream has at least some representation, but without turning the debates into a free-for-all. Comments?</p>"

I didn't quite see it that way. Obama was indeed halting and unfocused, which made him appear oddly unprepared, but I thought Romney's speaking style featured some equally unattractive qualities, ones we've seen in prior debates: he was nervously aggressive, spouted faux outrage over every single claim about his plans, repeatedly demanded more time to respond, and just generally oozed a sort of ADHD quality. Apparently, though, this bothers me more than most people.</p>
<p>But Obama's lack of focus bothered me too. For example, on three different occasions he claimed that Romney wanted to cut taxes by $5 trillion, and three times <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-in-denver-on-oct-3-running-transcript/2012/10/03/24d6eb6e-0d91-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_print.html"" target=""_blank"">Romney said that was wrong:</a></p>

<p>Governor Romney&rsquo;s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut....</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut....</p>
<p>If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion....</p>
<p>Let me repeat what I said. I&rsquo;m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That&rsquo;s not my plan....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is puzzling. The obvious gimmick here is to repeatedly refer to Romney's plan as a $5 trillion tax cut, which is sort of brazenly incorrect, as a way of baiting Romney into claiming that he's going to close loopholes and deductions that will make his plan revenue neutral. And it worked! That's exactly what Romney did.</p>
<p>This is a pretty good trap. After getting Romney to talk about deductions and loopholes on three separate occasions, it's the perfect time to make a withering comment about pigs in a poke and demand that he come clean. Is he going to do away with the home mortgage deduction? The charitable deduction? The healthcare deduction? &nbsp;<em>Come on, Governor Romney, level with us. No more snow jobs. Let's hear your real plan, not a bunch of supply-side happy talk.</em></p>
<p>It was perfect! Except that Obama never sprung the trap. Oh, he talked about ""the math,"" and about the ""analysts"" who say Romney's plan doesn't add up, and later on even got off a quip about Romney's ""secret plans."" But he never even tried to seriously hammer Romney on the point he was obviously setting up: <em>What are the deductions you're targeting? No more hiding. No more secrets. Tell us the other half of your plan.</em></p>
<p>This, to me, was the most peculiar single aspect of the debate. It seemed obvious that this was the road Obama was trying to lead Romney down, and it worked. But then he failed to follow up with the killing blow. Why?</p>"

I'll chalk that up to Sullivan's mercurial temperament, but now that I'm listening to the talking heads, it seems like there's a pretty fair consensus that Obama lost by a bunch. I'll stick to my guns on this: I think Obama lost by a little, but not by much.</p>
<p>Matt Yglesias tweets: ""It's interesting that conservatives who think they don't want Mitt to pivot to the center are clearly elated when he did it and it worked."" That's true. Romney repeatedly noted that he agreed with Obama on various issues and repeatedly took rhetorically moderate positions. For example: ""Regulation is essential. You can&rsquo;t have a free market work if you don&rsquo;t have regulation."" You sure wouldn't have heard him say that during one of the primary debates.</p>
<p>I didn't see this myself, but <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_10/spin_room040284.php"" target=""_blank"">Ed Kilgore</a> reports that the CBS&nbsp;instapoll has Romney winning by 46-22. Ouch. Looks like the talking heads called it better than me.</p>
<p>Noodling a little more about this, I think my disagreement with the media consensus is more over Romney's performance than Obama's. I agree that Obama didn't bring his A game. But I didn't think Romney was all that good either. Yes, he attacked, but he did it in a curiously hyperactive way, constantly insisting on getting in one more rebuttal and then using it to go over <em>every single</em> point that Obama had just made. I thought that was both confusing and exhausting. Romney also made frequent references to things that Beltway junkies understand but ordinary viewers probably didn't. The ""accounting treatment"" for oil companies, for example, or jumping into a point about Dodd-Frank without explaining what Dodd-Frank is. And for what it's worth, I suspect that Romney won't do well in the post-debate fact checks either. It won't be the disaster that Paul Ryan's convention speech was, but he seemed pretty clearly a little faster and looser with the truth than Obama was.</p>"

Neither Romney nor Obama seemed entirely comfortable. Romney struck me as too hyper, insisting in every segment on going over every single claim Obama had just made. The result was a bunch of laundry lists that never cohered into recognizable points. Obama seemed oddly hesitant and halting, as if he wasn't quite sure what points he wanted to make. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-in-denver-on-oct-3-running-transcript/2012/10/03/24d6eb6e-0d91-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_print.html"" target=""_blank"">Transcript here.</a></p>
<p>Neither candidate landed any serious blows. Obama came the closest, I thought, in the last half hour when he attacked Romney for all his secret plans. After noting that Romney wouldn't tell us which tax deductions he wants to cut, or how he wants to replace either Obamacare or Dodd-Frank, Obama delivered the best line of the night: ""Is the reason that Governor <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_debate_obama_2012_10_03.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />Romney is keeping all these plans secret because they&rsquo;re <em>too good</em>? Is it because somehow middle-class families are going to benefit <em>too much</em> from them?""</p>
<p>Did that make up for the fact that Obama was strangely incompetent at attacking Romney on his tax plan in the first half hour? Hard to say. But honestly, going after Romney on the tax deduction front seems pretty obvious, and I don't understand why Obama never really did it. Sure, he made a crack about ""the math,"" but he didn't come straight out and ask Romney if he planned to get rid of the home mortgage deduction, for example. That would have hit home a lot harder than hauling out a wonkish point about the ""independent analysts"" who say Romney's plan doesn't add up.</p>
<p>Romney avoided any big mistakes, and certainly projected more energy than Obama. But I didn't think he really delivered any great lines, or got off any really crisp explanations of his policies. I don't think tonight's performance will hurt him, but I doubt that it really helps him either.</p>
<p>Final score: I give Obama a B-, Romney a B.</p>
<hr width=""25%"" />
<p>Forget all that newfangled Twitter nonsense. We're going retro with some old school liveblogging of tonight's debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>10:24 -</strong> Lehrer: ""We've lost a pod.""</p>
<p><strong>10:23 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney is seriously rambling on education.</p>
<p><strong>10:22 -</strong>&nbsp;Obama keeps pulling back when he's obviously about to attack Romney. Not sure why.</p>
<p><strong>10:21 -</strong>&nbsp;No zingers so far. A few obviously canned lines, but nothing delivered with any zest.</p>
<p><strong>10:16 -</strong> ""I love great schools."" Uh huh. ""I reject the idea that I don&rsquo;t believe in great teachers."" Oh please. The faux outrage doesn't work here.</p>
<p><strong>10:15 -</strong> Obama's tic of constantly saying ""What I've said is...."" is annoying.</p>
<p><strong>10:13 - </strong>So Lehrer's approach for every topic is to ask the candidates if they think there are any differences between them? This really isn't working. It's just an invitation to give a stump speech.</p>
<p><strong>10:12 -</strong> Romney is answering with a bunch of possible options? Weak. Now retreating to talking points.</p>
<p><strong>10:11 -</strong> Ah, finally the attack on details. Romney won't tell us what deductions he'll cut. He won't tell us what he'll replace Dodd-Frank with. He won't tell us what he'll replace Obamacare with. ""Is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret because they're <em>too good</em>?"" Very good line.</p>
<p><strong>10:04 -</strong>&nbsp;Obama's IPAB explanation wasn't bad, but his speech is oddly halting and staccato tonight. He just doesn't seem fully in command of what he wants to say.</p>
<p><strong>10:03 -</strong> ""We didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare."" Oops.</p>
<p><strong>10:01 -</strong> ""The irony is that we&rsquo;ve seen this model work really well &mdash; in Massachusetts."" Good line.</p>
<p><strong>9:59 -</strong> ""Let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did."" Finally! Now let's see if he does a good job.</p>
<p><strong>9:54 -</strong>&nbsp;Starting to think that the old 60-second limits were a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>9:53 -</strong>&nbsp;Do most viewers know what Dodd-Frank is? Do they know what leverage limits are?</p>
<p><strong>9:47 -</strong> Obama's attack on vouchers is fairly effective. ""If you&rsquo;re 54 or 55, you might want to listen &lsquo;cause this will affect you.""</p>
<p><strong>9:44 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney's attack on the $716 billion that Obama cuts from Medicare was OK, but he should have stuck with it instead of flitting around to whatever other attack popped into his mind.</p>
<p><strong>9:43 -</strong>&nbsp;Obama is right that Social Security needs nothing more than modest tweaks.</p>
<p><strong>9:40 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney is all over the map trying to respond to every last thing Obama said.</p>
<p><strong>9:38 - </strong>""It's actually an accounting treatment...."" That's really not a good phrase to come out of Romney's mouth.</p>
<p><strong>9:36 -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;So far, neither of these guys has really done a crisp job of explaining their programs.</p>
<p><strong>9:34 -</strong>&nbsp;Romney going all in on the dynamic scoring fairy.</p>
<p><strong>9:33 - </strong>""You&rsquo;ve been president four years. You said you&rsquo;d cut the deficit in half. It&rsquo;s now four years later."" That's a good line.</p>
<p><strong>9:27 -</strong> ""I&rsquo;m going to stop the subsidy to PBS""? Seriously? ""I like PBS. I love Big Bird. Actually I like you, too."" Come on.</p>
<p><strong>9:25 -&nbsp;</strong>Romney's habit of arguing about how much time he has is something he really needs to overcome. Sounds childish.</p>
<p><strong>9:20 -</strong>&nbsp;Nope, no pushback on loopholes.</p>
<p><strong>9:18 -</strong> Is this $5 trillion tax cut thing a trap for Romney? Now Obama can ask him to list the loophole disclosures to pay for that $5 trillion.</p>
<p><strong>9:15 -</strong>&nbsp;Are these guys <em>trying</em> to be soporific?</p>
<p><strong>9:09 -</strong>&nbsp;A pair of stump speeches. I've forgotten what they said already.</p>
<p><strong>9:01</strong> - CNN has voter reaction in real time! Squiggly lines!</p>
<p><strong>8:58 -</strong> David Gergen says it's all about who's ""looser."" That's bad news already for Romney.</p>"

She has three reasons, and the first two boil down to the fact that Republicans aren't likely to suddenly stop being crazy just because we had an election, even if Obama wins.<sup>1</sup> I can buy that. <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/03/over-the-fiscal-cliff-by-hugo-first-and-betty-wont/"" target=""_blank"">But here's reason #3:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, I&rsquo;m somewhat skeptical that Democrats would have the political fortitude to go over the cliff.  Democrats could have stuck to their guns in the lame duck of 2010, forcing Republicans (still in the minority) to swallow an increase in upper income tax rates as the price for extending the middle class tax cuts.  That&rsquo;s not the strategy Democrats chose then, and it strikes me as equally unlikely in 2012 with a GOP House majority.  Going over the cliff requires Democrats to take ownership of raising taxes on the middle class at Christmas.  That might be the strategically wise move for bolstering Democrats&rsquo; leverage come January.  But it also strikes me as an electorally doubtful holiday gift to voters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not so sure about that. In this case, I think I'm with the folks who like to refer to this event as a fiscal slope rather than a fiscal cliff. Their general point is that we don't all suddenly pay thousands of dollars in taxes and cut billions of dollars in spending at the stroke of midnight on January 1st. This stuff all phases in over time.</p>
<p>That's true, and I doubt very much that there would be any serious consequences to doing a deal in February or March instead of December. In the particular case of taxes, the only thing that happens on January 1st is that withholding rates would go up slightly &mdash; and maybe not even that. The IRS has a fair amount of latitude to leave withholding rates alone for a few months if it wants to. Either way, this means that Democrats don't really have to worry about ""owning"" the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for quite a while. (The payroll tax holiday also expires on December 31, but that was always unlikely to be extended anyway. It doesn't have much to do with the fiscal cliff.)</p>
<p>For a few months, then, taxpayers won't see much impact. Maybe none at all. As a result, I think Democrats could pretty safely stick to their guns and extend negotiations into 2013 without much risk. At that point, with the Bush tax cuts gone and rates back up to their Clinton-era levels, they'll still have to convince Republicans to introduce a bill that cuts only the middle-income rates, not the top marginal rates, and that won't be easy. But Republicans will be under as much pressure as Democrats by that point, and they might very well be willing to do a deal.</p>
<p>In short, as long as the composition of Congress doesn't change dramatically, I don't think the calculus is much different before and after January 1st. The cliff doesn't really start to get scary until later in the year.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>This entire post is predicated on the likelihood that Obama will win reelection and the House will remain fairly solidly in Republican hands. If either of those doesn't happen, the legislative calculus changes completely.</p>"

Yesterday Mitt Romney told a Denver TV station that he had some new ideas about his plan to reduce tax deductions in order to make up for the <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/romney-suggests-uniform-tax-break-possibly-17000/story?id=17374494#.UGyPE0YS7Tr"" target=""_blank"">20% across-the-board rate cuts he's promised:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an option you could say everybody's going to get up to a $17,000 deduction; and you could use your charitable deduction, your home mortgage deduction, or others &mdash;&nbsp;your healthcare deduction. And you can fill that <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_show_math.jpg"" style=""margin: 20px 10px 15px 30px;"" />bucket, if you will, that $17,000 bucket that way. And higher income people might have a lower number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't commented on this yet for several reasons. First, it was casually tossed out. It's not clear if Romney is serious about this. Second, it's a little unclear exactly what he meant: a $17,000 max on deductions from your gross income, or a $17,000 max on how much your tax bill can be reduced? Third, it's still missing crucial details. When Romney says ""healthcare deduction,"" is he talking about the exclusion of healthcare benefits from your taxable income? Is that $17,000 cap for single filers or couples? Does it include the personal exemption and dependent exemptions? Etc. Fourth, he didn't provide a number for higher income people, just a hint that it might be lower than $17,000. Fifth, there's no telling how the math works out on this.</p>
<p>The first four of these things require more detail from Romney. The fifth requires an analysis from the Tax Policy Center or some similar outfit. In the meantime, there's not a lot of point in commenting on something with so many missing pieces.</p>
<p>So for now I'll limit myself to saying that it's highly unlikely that the math works out here. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/romney-just-quietly-announced-a-good-tax-policy-idea.html"" target=""_blank"">Josh Barro</a> thinks that virtually everyone making under $200,000 would see either a net tax decrease or no change at all under this proposal. And we already know that even if every single deduction for those making over $200,000 were completely eliminated, <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/10/251-165-0-0"" target=""_blank"">they'd see a net tax decrease too.</a> So no matter how Romney fills in the blanks, this would amount to a net tax decrease. There's just no way that it becomes revenue neutral, as Romney has promised, without a massive sprinkling of dynamic scoring fairy dust.</p>"

I was going to do it anyway because Nicholas Beaudrot told me to, <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_08/014294.php"" target=""_blank"">so here it is:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of a ""statistical tie"" is based on the theory that (a) statistical results are credible only if they are at least 95% certain to be accurate, and (b) any lead less than a poll's margin of error is less than 95% certain.</p>
<p>There are two problems with this: first, 95% is not some kind of magic cutoff point, and second, the idea that the MOE represents 95% certainty is wrong anyway. A poll's MOE does represent a 95% confidence interval for each individual's percentage, but it doesn't represent a 95% confidence for the <em>difference</em> between the two, and that's what we're really interested in.</p>
<p>In fact, what we're really interested in is the probability that the difference is greater than zero &mdash; in other words, that one candidate is genuinely ahead of the other. But this probability isn't a cutoff, it's a continuum: the bigger the lead, the more likely that someone is ahead and that the result isn't just a polling fluke. So instead of lazily reporting any result within the MOE as a ""tie,"" which is statistically wrong anyway, it would be more informative to just go ahead and tell us how probable it is that a candidate is really ahead. Here's a table that gives you the answer to within a point or two:</p>
<img align=""middle"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_moe_2008.gif"" style=""margin: 3px 0px 5px 75px;"" />
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty handy, no? Most national polls have an MOE of about 3%, so you can usually just use that row. NBC, for example, <a href=""http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14186700-nbcwsj-poll-obama-maintains-lead-but-romney-within-striking-distance"" target=""_blank"">puts Obama ahead of Romney right now by 49-46%.</a> So what are the odds that Obama is really ahead, and this isn't just a statistical fluke? Answer:&nbsp;84%.</p>
<p>But now for the bad news: As fun as it is to haul this thing out every few years, it's obsolete. If you want to know who's ahead, there are now loads of sites that aggregate multiple polls in various ways to provide estimates with far less margin of error than any single poll. If Pollster or RCP says that Obama is ahead by three points, then the odds are that he really is ahead by three points. There's still plenty of room for various kinds of error in these poll-of-polls averages, but pure sample error isn't really one of them any more.</p>
<p>For the record, as of today Pollster has Obama ahead by 4.3%; RCP has Obama ahead by 4.0%; Sam Wang's meta-margin has Obama ahead by 5.06%; and Nate Silver has Obama ahead by 3.9%. I think it's pretty safe to say that, at this moment in time, Obama is comfortably ahead.</p>"

What's more, he says, recent studies suggest that <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/swing-voters-climate-change-issue"" target=""_blank"">climate can even be a winning political issue:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first of these studies emerged in 2011 from Stanford pollster Jon Krosnick and his colleagues....Both Democrats and independents strongly favored a green candidate over a neutral one, while for Republicans it was basically a wash&mdash;neither a pro or anti-climate candidate moved them much. ""By taking a green position on climate, candidates of either party can gain votes,"" Krosnick's team concluded.</p>
<p>....Their findings were reinforced earlier this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason who, in a March 2012 survey, similarly found that taking a stand on climate has the potential to motivate Democratic and independent voters, without causing damage among Republicans.</p>
<p>.... In a survey of 1,204 likely voters in May of 2012, [Andrew] Maxfield found that a ""clean energy"" candidate fared better than an ""all-of-the-above"" candidate who supported a variety of energy choices&mdash;coal, drilling, and also clean energy. Maxfield then went on to test a variety of climate messages&mdash;and the upshot, he says, is that ""if you feel strongly about climate change, there is a way to talk about it that voters will understand and appreciate""&mdash;especially if candidates focus on recent extreme weather. ""I was surprised at the strength of that, and the extent to which voters had begun to recognize the severe weather, and experience it,"" Maxfield says.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I remain skeptical. In a vacuum, supporting green policies has always been a popular position. And it's always been true that there are good ways to talk about climate change and bad ways. I'm not sure anything big has changed here.</p>
<p>The problem is that you don't always get to talk about political issues the way you want to. Your opponents get to talk about them too. And they won't be shy about labeling virtually any serious green policy as a price hike for consumers and a regulatory burden for business. What's more, conservatives have an unusual advantage when they say this: it's actually true. Things like carbon taxes and cap-and-trade policies really will increase the price of energy for consumers. That's the whole point. Conversely, if you limit yourself to generally popular issues like CAFE standards and building more solar plants in the desert, voters will support it, but only because the price hike is small enough (and hidden enough) that it has only a modest impact on climate change in the first place.</p>
<p>What really matters, then, is what happens when potential voters are presented with messaging from both sides. To get an idea of how effective this is, take a look at the <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/153608/Global-Warming-Views-Steady-Despite-Warm-Winter.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Gallup polls below.</a> The first poll asks people if the threat of global warming is generally exaggerated or not, and it hits bottom in 2006, at about the time of the release of Al Gore's <em>An Inconvenient Truth.</em> Then it starts to rise as conservatives fight back, reaching a peak in 2010, shortly after the release of the ""Climategate"" emails. It's gone down since then, which is good news, but it's still way higher than it was even five years ago. Likewise, the bottom chart shows that even Democrats and Independents are far more likely to think that news of global warming is exaggerated than they were back in 2006.</p>
<p>So there's a long way to go before public opinion is anywhere near where it needs to be. We need to get to a point where even if people know that it means an increase in gasoline and electricity prices &mdash; <em>even if their noses are rubbed in it</em> &mdash; they still support serious green policies. This is the work ahead of us.</p>

<ol>
<li>Income inequality goes up.</li>
    <li>As a result, earnings of the middle class become sluggish....</li>
    <li>And earnings of the rich skyrocket, a trend reinforced by lower tax rates on both labor and capital income.</li>
    <li>Rich people eventually run out of sensible things to invest all this money in (because consumer demand is sluggish, see #2), so they get stupid.</li>
    <li>Stupid money finances stupid loans to middle-class borrowers who can't afford them (because their incomes are sluggish, see #2).</li>

<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_wall_street_fallen_bull.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 15px 10px 15px 30px;"" />This all works great until it doesn't. When it doesn't, the economy goes kablooey.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the aughts, #5 took the form of increasing corruption in the mortgage loan market and increasingly baroque Wall Street financial concoctions to package up all those corrupt loans. It worked great for about five or six years, followed by a Wile E. Coyote moment where the economy was suspended in limbo for a year or so, followed by an epic crash that we still haven't dug our way out of.</p>
<p>I'm just a blogger, though, so there's no special reason you should take me seriously. However, a reader alerted me to a recent <em>National Journal</em> piece by Jonathan Rauch that suggests this theory is <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/essay-the-growing-income-gap-in-the-u-s-harms-the-economy-20120927"" target=""_blank"">gaining ground among serious economists:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once in a while, a new economic narrative gives renewed strength to an old political ideology. Two generations ago, supply-side economics transformed conservatism&rsquo;s case against big government from a merely ideological claim to an economic one....Something potentially analogous is stirring among the Left. An emerging view holds that inequality has reached levels that are damaging not only to liberals&rsquo; sense of justice but to the economy&rsquo;s stability and growth. If this narrative catches on, it could give the egalitarian Left new purchase in the national economic debate.</p>
<p>....As Christopher Brown, an economist at Arkansas State University, put it in a pioneering 2004 paper, &ldquo;Income inequality can exert a significant drag on effective demand.&rdquo; Looking back on the two decades before 1986, Brown found that <strong>if the gap between rich and poor hadn&rsquo;t grown wider, consumption spending would have been almost 12 percent higher than it actually was.</strong></p>
<p>....So inequality might suppress growth. It might also cause instability. In a democracy, politicians and the public are unlikely to accept depressed spending power if they can help it....They might, for example, create policies allowing banks to write flimsy home mortgages and encouraging consumers to seek them....That is not a bad description of what happened in the 1920s and again during these past few years. <strong>&ldquo;When&mdash;as appears to have happened in the long run-up to both crises&mdash;the rich lend a large part of their added income to the poor and middle class, and when income inequality grows for several decades,&rdquo;</strong> the IMF&rsquo;s Michael Kumhof and Romain Ranci&egrave;re wrote, &ldquo;debt-to-income ratios increase sufficiently to raise the risk of a major crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But wait. Which is it? Does inequality depress demand? Or does it inflate credit bubbles that maintain demand? Unfortunately, the answer can be both. If inequality is severe enough, there could be enough of it to cause the country to inflate a dangerous credit bubble and still not offset the reduction in demand.</p>
<p>And, no, we&rsquo;re not finished. Inequality may also be destabilizing in another way. &ldquo;Of every dollar of real income growth that was generated between 1976 and 2007,&rdquo; Rajan wrote, &ldquo;58 cents went to the top 1 percent of households.&rdquo; In other words, for decades, more than half of the increase in the country&rsquo;s GDP poured into the bank accounts of the richest Americans, who needed liquid investments in which to put their additional wealth. <strong>Their appetite for new investment vehicles fueled a surge in what Arkansas State&rsquo;s Brown calls &ldquo;financial engineering&rdquo;&mdash;the concoction of exotic financial instruments, which acted on the financial sector like steroids.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole thing is worth a read. This model of inequality and financial crises has some powerful proponents, but it's hardly a mainstream consensus at this point. It's worth keeping an eye on, though. There might be some serious explanatory power here.</p>"

In the wake of the disastrous attacks on American interests in North Africa on 9/11/2012, the Obama regime seems to have engaged in a calculated policy of disinformation to hide the magnitude of their failure from the Congress and the public. Now, in an attempt to keep the lie alive, they are claiming they were ill-served by the US intelligence community.<div class=""feedflare"">

In an effort to bolster his image, his regime went about knocking over doddering, toothless autocrats as a way of proving his toughness. They didn't give much thought to who would succeed them.

Look to Germany, Boston College professor Kent Greenfield <a href=""http://www.democracyjournal.org/26/the-stakeholder-strategy.php?page=all"">argues</a> in the latest issue of <em>Democracy</em>.</p> <p>Through a process called ?codetermination,? large German companies are required to elect half their board of directors by a vote of their employees, rather than of their shareholders. And it?s ?now the economic powerhouse of Europe,? Greenfield contends.</p> <p>How much the latter is true is pretty arguable. Germany does not have the kind of widespread unemployment that plagues the rest of the continent, but it also has much more <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/09/25/german_wage_stagnation_is_it_the_real_secret_to_their_employment_success_.html"">severe wage stagnation</a>. So it?s hardly a paradise. But Greenfield?s piece raises a good question: What have the results of codetermination been for Germany, both for growth and for workers? share of that growth?</p> <p>The best research on this in English-language publications has come from John Addison of the University of South Carolina. He, along with Claus Schnabel and Joachim Wagner, recently produced a <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=446402"">literature review</a> summarizing all 17 studies that have been conducted on codetermination to date. There have been three stages of research, each using better data than the last, but the most recent is almost uniformly positive toward the councils.</p> <p>While there?s little evidence that they increase sales or overall employment, they do seem to have a positive effect on productivity, according to the two most recent studies on that question. One, from <a href=""http://wiwi.uni-paderborn.de/dep1/organisations-medienoekonomie-prof-dr-frick/team/prof-dr-bernd-frick/"">Bernd Frick</a>, found that Western German firms saw a huge 25 percent spike in productivity, while Eastern German firms transitioning out of Communism saw an even bigger 30 percent jump. Previous research almost uniformly found that the councils increase wages.</p> <p>That said, some suggested that the effects on productivity are blunted for small firms, or those without unions. Addison and his coauthors do urge skepticism of the more recent productivity numbers, noting that getting a good sample for comparisons is tough.

While that usually works out fine for large employers, who can spread the costs among a big pool of employees, it could cause costs to spike for a smaller company. For that reason, only about 10 percent of firms with fewer than 200 employees self-insure ? but that number<a href=""http://www.ebri.org/pdf/FFE114.11Feb09.Final.pdf"" target=""_blank""> rises</a> to 89 percent among firms with more than 5,000 employees. </p> <p>Many companies that self-insure also buy ?stop loss? insurance, meant to protect again unpredictable, especially catastrophic events ? the possibility, for example, that a number of employees need an expensive surgery at the exact same time.</p> <p>The Affordable Care Act exempts self-insured plans from a number of mandates: They don?t have to pay <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/28/pf/taxes/health_reform_new_taxes/index.htm"">an excise tax</a> if they provide more expensive benefits and don?t have to adhere <a href=""http://www.uhc.com/united_for_reform_resource_center/health_reform_provisions/medical_loss_ratio.htm"">to the 80/20 rule</a>, which requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical costs. </p> <p>Laszewski wonders whether a free pass from those benefits might push small businesses to get a bit riskier.</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The ability of small employers to in effect opt-out of the ACA?s stiffest insurance reform requirements by moving to self-insurance is on the cusp of becoming a market trend. Some insurers are offering to take over the liability for individual health insurance claims (the ?attachment point?) as low as $10,000 in the very small employer health insurance market??the employer is on the hook for claim costs below that point. </p> <p>Regulators are worried about self-selection in the market??the healthiest small groups going self-insured and refusing to be part of the ACA?s insurance exchange pool leaving only the sickest small groups to fall under the ACA.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Laszewski runs through a few ways that state legislatures could blunt this change, namely by raising that ?attachment point? higher and higher. California<a href=""http://www.locktonhealthreformblog.com/healthreform/2012/04/california-bill-seeks-to-curtail-use-of-stop-loss-insurance-by-small-self-funded-health-plans/"">, for example, has looked at</a> legislation that wouldn?t allow stop-loss insurance to kick in until $95,000 in claims per employee have been paid out. The stop loss insurance I mentioned earlier would only kick in after the employer has paid tens of thousands of dollars in claims.</p> <p>That would make the move towards self-insurance, even with the freedom from mandates it offers, a significantly riskier proposal.</p> <p></p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/243575d4/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544471442/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/243575d4/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544471442/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/243575d4/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544471442/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/243575d4/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

After all, who <em>doesn?t</em> love a good study showing that a peek at adorable kitten pics <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/01/want-to-increase-your-productivity-study-says-look-at-this-adorable-kitten/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein"">can amp up your productivity</a> at work?</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://blog.washingtonpost.com/story-lab/,DanaInfo%3Dmerlin.washpost.com%2BX00026_9.JPG"" /> </p> </p> <p>But now comes a brand-new <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0044275"">paper</a> in the <em>Public Library of Science</em> suggesting that? well, that we should all be wary of hot new research that?s trumpeted by the press. This isn?t an argument against science. The scientific process works quite well in sifting strong claims from weak ones. The problem, it turns out, is that the media tends to over-emphasize exciting new findings while rarely following up to see whether those conclusions have been re-affirmed or debunked later on.</p> <p>To see this, the authors, led by François Gonon of the University of Bordeaux, looked at 47 different scientific publications on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) published during the 1990s, and then went through 347 English-language newspaper articles covering the research. From there, they culled the top ten papers and looked at the coverage. And what they found was stunning.</p> <p>Those ten papers on ADHD received an outpour of press coverage?223 newspaper articles written in the sample. That?s not surprising, since most of them were advancing new hypotheses about ADHD. But those ten studies <em>also</em> generated a lot of follow-up research. In all, there were at least 67 follow-up biomedical studies that ended up either debunking or weakening most of the initial research. Yet newspapers were much less thorough in covering these subsequent papers?the debunking work generated just 57 newspaper articles.</p> <p>There?s a clear imbalance here, note Gonon and his colleagues. The biomedical papers that get the most attention are often the most novel, finding some unexpected effect or testing new hypotheses. But, precisely because they are so novel, they?re more likely to be untrue. That would be fine, except newspapers tend to highlight the initial studies while paying less attention to the party-pooping follow-ups.</p> <p>Part of the problem, too, is with the journals themselves. Those thrilling initial studies tend to get published in the most prestigious medical journals, like <em>Lancet</em> or the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, whereas the follow-ups are often confined to less-visible outlets that few reporters read.</p> <p>The study doesn?t say whether this press bias occurs in other areas of coverage, such as economics or political science. We?ll need?yes?follow-ups to Gonon?s research! But let?s assume this is a widespread problem. Is there an easy solution? That?s less clear.</p> <p>After all, it?s great when an organization like the <a href=""http://www.nas.edu/"">National Academies of Science</a> or the <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> can write up a big, thorough overview of a scientific topic, sifting through many studies in order to judge claims and counterclaims. Those assessments are a good antidote to relying on a single, much-hyped new paper on a topic. But those thorough assessments don?t come along very often?the IPCC, for instance, typically takes five or six years to release its updated reports on the state of climate science.</p> <p>The Economist, which <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21563275?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/journalistic_deficit_disorder"">has a good write-up</a> of Gonon?s paper, offers this common-sense advice: ?The matter goes beyond simply not believing what you read in the newspapers. Rather, it is a question of remembering that if you do not read subsequent confirmation, then the original conclusion may have fallen by the wayside.? And over at the New York Times, Andrew Revkin <a href=""http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/from-abstract-to-news-release-to-story-a-tilt-to-the-front-page-thought/"">has a fascinating post</a> wrestling with the difficulty that science reporters face in conveying the complexity of new scientific research without making their coverage too boring. </p> <p>In any case, Gonon?s study offers a good cautionary tale. Academic research is fascinating! But it?s important to check up on what follow up studies say?those tedious-sounding papers languishing in B-list journals that find no effect for a clever new medical treatment is probably worth a blog post. (And yes, we?ll be sure to keep an eye out for whether anyone comes along with a study that debunks Gonon?s findings?)</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-worlds-most-boring-journal--and-why-its-good-for-science/2012/03/01/gIQAwZf4kR_blog.html"">The world?s most boring journal?and why it?s good for science.</a> </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24303bc1/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544382073/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24303bc1/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544382073/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24303bc1/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544382073/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24303bc1/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

But male employment has also recovered at a faster pace. At their lowest point of employment in early 2010, men had 6.1 million fewer jobs than in January 2007, and they?ve now regained 3 million, or nearly 50 percent, of those jobs since then, according to the Institute for Women?s Policy Research. </p> <p>By contrast, women have lost fewer jobs than men?both in real and relative terms?but it?s taken them longer to recover. Since the beginning of the recession, they?ve regained 1.2 million, or 46 percent, of the total jobs they?ve lost since their lowest employment in the recession, in September 2010. That?s in part because women hold a disproportionate number of public-sector jobs, as Dana Goldstein has <a href=""http://www.danagoldstein.net/dana_goldstein/2011/02/the-wisconsin-labor-fight-an-attack-on-women-too.html"">pointed out</a>, which were aided temporarily through the stimulus but which have been slower to come back than the private sector.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/women-jobs.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>In recent months, however, women?s employment has begun to accelerate.

Paul Leigh at the University of California in Davis has taken one of the most in depth ? and most recent ? <a href=""http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/6969"">looks</a> at what doctors earn. He finds that over a lifetime, a primary care doctor can expect to make $1.5 million less than a medical school classmate who goes into specialty care ? and $2.8 million less than a doctor in the best-paid specialty, neurological surgery.</p> <p>Here?s the full chart of how the earnings of various doctors stack up:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/docpay.png""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/docpay.png"" /> </p> <br /> </a>This aligns with <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/success-of-health-reform-hinges-on-hiring-30000-primary-care-doctors-by-2015/2012/02/06/gIQAnslQ4Q_story.html"">previous research</a> that has also shown a big pay gap between primary care doctors and specialists. (There is some variation, though, which may be a product of certain studies not accounting for variables like gender and payment during residency, which tends to be lower).</p> <p>One big question this study raises is: How much does the pay gap matter to medical students? Research from the Graham Center found, perhaps surprisingly, that it might not factor in as much as we thought: Having higher student debt actually correlates with a higher likelihood of pursuing a primary care career. Debt-free doctors, the thinking goes, are more likely to come from a higher income background ? and expect a higher salary. Those who accumulate debt to pursue a medical degree may have lower expectations ? or put less emphasis on ? their ultimate earnings.</p> <p>More recent research on medical student decision-making suggests even more nuance to how doctors select their ultimate career path. Yeshiva University?s Martha Grayson recently looked at students who entered medical school intending to pursue a career in primary care ? and how much debt they accrued. <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04340.x/abstract"">Her research</a>, published in the journal <em>Medical Education</em>, did find a relationship between debt and career choice: Students with more debt were more likely to shift their career path away from primary care.</p> <p>?Compared with their peers who sustained PC [primary care] career goals, those who switched career goals anticipated more debt and attached greater value to income,? Grayson concludes. ?Moreover, the decision to switch was associated with a marked increase in income expectations of an average of US$75,153.? </p> <p>Her research suggests ? much as would be expected ? that money does indeed matter in career decision making. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242bab3a/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417611/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242bab3a/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417611/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242bab3a/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544417611/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242bab3a/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

So China is rethinking its strategy:</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_296w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/ezra-klein/Images/509815364.jpg?uuid=5ajFvHNhEeG3R-5kJlrmxg"" /> </p> </p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The result is a looming financial disaster, not only for manufacturers but for state-owned banks that financed factories with approximately $18 billion in low-rate loans and for municipal and provincial governments that provided loan guarantees and sold manufacturers valuable land at deeply discounted prices.</p> <p>China?s biggest solar panel makers are suffering losses of up to $1 for every $3 of sales this year, as panel prices have fallen by three-fourths since 2008. ?</p> <p>The outcome has left even the architects of China?s renewable energy strategy feeling frustrated and eager to see many businesses shut down, so the most efficient companies may be salvageable financially.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>To get a sense for the scale here, we can compare what China and the United States have done for solar in recent times. As part of the stimulus program, the U.S. Department of Energy has handed out roughly <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/story/2011-10-03/solar-power-funds/50646694/1"">$14 billion</a> in federal loan guarantees to domestic solar projects since 2009. Most of this money has gone into R&#38;D and advanced technologies?including, yes, $535 million for Solyndra. (There has also been a <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Pages/1603.aspx"">refundable tax credit</a> for anyone who generates electricity from solar power in the United States, but that benefits all companies equally.)</p> <p>By contrast, China?s state-owned banks alone have shelled out $18 billion in low-rate, preferential loans to solar companies over the past five years ? most of which have gone to basic factories and manufacturers. In addition, China?s local governments have provided a slew of loan guarantees and cheap land to solar producers. Bradsher reports that the total subsidies could come to $50 billion over the next 20 years for every 10 gigawatts of solar power installed. That?s an enormous difference.</p> <p>So it?s not surprising that China now dominates the solar market. The country has about two-thirds of the world?s solar manufacturing capacity and was churning out panels for less than $1 per watt at the end of 2011, about <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/chinas-growing-share-of-solar-market-comes-at-a-price/2011/11/21/gIQAhPRWyO_print.html"">20 percent cheaper</a> than anywhere else on Earth. That helps explain why, in the United States, the retail price of solar power has fallen by half and why rooftop installations doubled in 2011.</p> <p>But the party may end soon. Bradsher reports that China?s economic planners want to cut off loans for all but the strongest solar manufacturers and let the rest go bankrupt. Would that be a good thing? It depends. The price of Chinese solar panels would likely rise as a result. That would provide a boost to U.S. solar manufacturers who have been struggling against cheaper Chinese imports. (In May, the U.S. Commerce Department slapped a <a href=""http://ia.ita.doc.gov/download/factsheets/factsheet-prc-solar-cells-ad-prelim-20120517.pdf"" target=""_blank"">31 percent tariff</a> on imports of silicon photovoltaic cells from certain Chinese manufacturers, alleging that they were unfairly subsidized.)</p> <p>Over at Resources for the Future, Nathan Richardson <a href=""http://common-resources.org/2012/china-losing-money-on-solar-a-good-thing-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CommonResources+%28Common+Resources%29"">takes a different view</a>: ?[C]heap solar panels are fantastic in their own right,? he notes. ?It doesn?t really matter who makes them. If we can buy cheap panels from China, we can spend the resources we?d otherwise use on other things. ?  China?s solar policy may not be a good idea economically (for China). But they are doing their bit, perhaps unintentionally, to build the technology that can avert climate change.?</p> <p>In any case, not all analysts are convinced that the surge in U.S. solar installations would collapse if China were to consolidate its solar industry. Back in May, in a <a href=""http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/05/china_solar.html"">policy brief</a> for the Center for American Progress, Melanie Hart and Kate Gordon pointed out that the key drivers of America?s solar surge have been demand-side policies, such as tax credits for installation or state-level renewable energy standards, and not low Chinese prices. ?If you look within the U.S. market,? Hart and Gordon write, ?there is a huge amount of variation from state to state, and <a href=""http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/us--installations-rise-but-dominated-by-california_100004705/#axzz1u72G1gIW"">that variation</a> is primarily due to differences in state incentives.?</p> <p>So China?s frantic push to hand out cheap solar panels (and wind turbines) to the rest of the world could soon slow down. But that won?t necessarily mean the end of the world?s <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/06/19/are-we-wildly-underestimating-solar-and-wind-power/"">recent solar-power boom</a> ? that will depend on whether countries like the United States enact further policies to boost renewables or not.</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/06/19/are-we-wildly-underestimating-solar-and-wind-power/"">Are we wildly underestimating solar and wind power?</a> </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242baa3c/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417497/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242baa3c/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544417497/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242baa3c/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544417497/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242baa3c/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Mitt Romney said during Wednesday?s debate, ?preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.?</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/255px-Romney_portrait.jpeg"" /> </p> </p> <p>Actually, they?re not. Romney?s campaign admitted as much later in the night. If you?ve been uninsured at any point in the past couple of years, you?re not protected under Romney?s plan. The Commonwealth Fund says that means <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/10/who-would-be-left-out-of-romneys-preexisting-conditions-plan-about-89-million-americans/"">89 million</a> Americans will be left out in the cold. As Paul Krugman <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/opinion/krugman-romneys-sick-joke.html?_r=1&#38;hp"">notes</a>, that?s a third of the non-elderly population.</p> <p>But there?s something else Romney said about health care at the debate that matters much more, but is getting much less attention.</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let?s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>A fair read of that statement would make you think Romney wants to make it possible for every state to follow Massachusetts?s example. But a fair read of his policies makes it clear that Romney wants to make it impossible for any state to follow Massachusetts?s example ? and perhaps impossible for Massachusetts to keep the very plan Romney passed going.</p> <p>The key question for any health-care plan is how are you going to pay for it? The Massachusetts plan used three funding sources.</p> <p>The first ? and, in some ways, the most important ? was a $385 million annual payment then-Sen. Ted Kennedy had negotiated for the state?s safety net hospitals. President George W. Bush wanted to end the payment. That set off a panic in Massachusetts, and led to Romney and Kennedy going to the Bush administration and making a deal: Massachusetts could keep the money if they put it towards a universal health-care plan. Oh, and they needed to come up with that plan soon.</p> <p>This was the threat that forced Romney and the state?s Democrats to pass a plan, as not passing a plan would mean losing billions in free federal money.</p> <p>The state also found two other funding sources. They covered absolutely everyone they could cover in their Medicaid program so they could get the most generous possible match from the federal government. Right now, Medicaid is helping Massachusetts cover kids and adults up to 300 percent of the poverty line ? an incredible deal.</p> <p>Finally, Massachusetts had imposed a tax to reimburse hospitals for the care they provided to the uninsured. Romney took the money from that tax and put it toward the law.</p> <p>That?s two pots of federal money and a tax. So how much of Romney?s proposal relied on these funds? ?100 percent,? says Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who helped Romney design the law. ?That was my whole job. Saying whether we could fit what he wanted to do within those three funding sources.?</p> <p>The legislature ended up adding a bit of general revenue to the law. But the fact remains: The Massachusetts law relies on federal dollars and state taxes.</p> <p>But Romney?s health-care proposal doesn?t make it easier for other states to follow the Massachusetts example. It makes it almost impossible. He?s not offering states access to federal funds for universal coverage. Here?s what he?s doing:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you?re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you?re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. </p> </blockquote> </p> <p>That sounds nice, but it?s a cut to Medicaid of <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/17/romneys-health-care-plans-dont-exempt-todays-seniors/?print=1"">more than $600 billion</a>. And that?s before we even get into Romney?s repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which pushes the Medicaid cuts well above $1 trillion. That means Medicaid won?t be able to offer such generous matches in the future. </p> <p>?He?s pulling up the ladder behind him,? Gruber says. ?There?s a legitimate issue of can Massachusetts even do it anymore? If they block grant us and don?t let the block grants grow, federal funds will become a smaller and smaller share. And we never would?ve done this at 100 percent state funding.?</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242b93c8/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544356491/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242b93c8/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544356491/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242b93c8/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544356491/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242b93c8/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Ezra has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/05/september-jobs-report-debunking-the-jobs-report-conspiracy-theories/"">dispatched</a> with those quite nicely. But it raises a broader question. How does the Bureau of Labor Statistics derive these numbers? How accurate is that process? And how susceptible is it to tampering?</p> <p>The jobs report actually compiles the results of two different surveys: the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is commonly dubbed the ?household survey,? and Current Economic Statistics (CES), or the ?employer survey.? The household survey produces the unemployment rate, and the employer survey produces the ?nonfarm payrolls? number, which is the most common measure of jobs gained.</p> <p> <strong>Household survey</strong> </p> <p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/faq.htm#Ques2"">CPS</a> is a monthly survey of households that asks which people in the household have worked (or were temporarily absent) in the past week; which have actively looked for work in the past month but did not work; and which neither looked for work nor worked. It?s jointly run by BLS and the Census Bureau and has been conducted since 1940.</p> <p>The number of people who either worked or looked for work is defined as the ?labor force?. The CPS calculates both the ?labor force participation rate? ? which is the fraction of people over 16 and not in prison who are in the labor force ? and the ?unemployment rate?, which is the percentage of the labor force not working.</p> <p>It also calculates a number of ?alternative? unemployment measures by asking if members of the household have concluded that no work is available (the ?U-4? measure), have given up looking for work but would still like a job (the ?U-5? measure), or are working part-time but would like to be working full-time (the ?U-6? measure). These tend to be higher than the regular unemployment rate. This month, U-6 was unchanged because a lot of the job gains came in part-time work, but all the others went down.</p> <p>BLS also asks if members of the household lost their jobs in the month in question, and if they?ve been unemployed more than 15 weeks. Both of these measures went down last month, which is another sign that the labor market is recovering.</p> <p>The CPS sample includes about <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/homch1_f.htm"">66,000 households</a>. Every month, 25 percent of the sample is changed, so that the sample is not just studying the same group of people. The response rate is very high ? usually <a href=""http://www.census.gov/cps/methodology/nonresponse.html"">more than 90 percent</a>. By contrast, opinion polls have a response rate of around <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/poll-response-rates_n_1518501.html"">9 percent</a>, and contain samples a fraction of that size.</p> <p>But even still, there is a lot of room for error. The BLS <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf"" target=""_blank"">estimates</a> that the standard error for the unemployment rate is 0.1 points. That means that the margin of error, like that you?d use for polls, is about 0.196 points:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/unemployment_error.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/unemployment_error.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>It?s higher for <em>changes</em> in the unemployment rate ? the standard error is 0.12, so the margin of error is around 0.2352. But the drop in unemployment last month was 0.3 points ? so outside the margin of error, and statistically significant. As former Labor Department economist Betsy Stevenson explains, that?s a <a href=""http://twitter.com/BetseyStevenson/status/254238435022344192"">clear improvement</a>.</p> <p> <strong>Employer survey</strong> </p> <p>What about the CES? That <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ces/cesfaq.htm#scope1"">surveys</a> 141,000 employers, both private and public, at 486,000 worksites and asks for the number of employees, hours worked, and earnings. ?Employees? includes both part-time and full-time labor, and is a snapshot taken at the twelfth of the month. ?Employment is the total number of persons on establishment payrolls employed full-or part-time who received pay for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th day of the month,? BLS explains. It excludes the self-employed, volunteers, farm workers, and domestic workers. But it includes workers who are on strike, and those working for two different businesses are double-counted.</p> <p>The <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesvarae.htm#t2fa1"">standard error</a> for CES is enormous - 55,254 for monthly change. That means the margin of error (at a 95 percent confidence level) is 108,293 ? nearly the total number of jobs gained last month. So this month?s job gain was statistically different from zero, but many past ones were not:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/payrolls_error.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/payrolls_error.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>What?s this about the seasons?</strong> </p> <p>Both the CPS and the CES use a process called ?seasonal adjustment.? They figure that employment usually follows certain seasonal patterns. Construction workers don?t work in the winter, high school and college graduates get hired in the spring, teachers get laid off for the summer, etc. They then adjust the number of employed and unemployed people by what you?d expect to change due to seasonal factors.</p> <p>As Brad has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/05/wait-the-u-s-economy-actually-lost-1-2-million-jobs-in-july/"">noted</a>, there?s some evidence that the adjustment formula has gone awry, as there is a wide divergence in the summer and winter jobs numbers, with the latter usually stronger, as you can see in the above figure.</p> <p> <strong>How secure is it?</strong> </p> <p>As my colleague Eli Saslow <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jobs-day-an-economic-and-political-obsession/2012/03/09/gIQADZPW1R_story.html"">notes</a>, the BLS process is highly confidential. Economists are put on an eight-day security lockdown in advance of the report, signing confidentiality agreements every morning. The computers they use feature heavy encryption, and data is placed in a safe even for bathroom breaks. The Wednesday before the release, the CPS data comes in, followed by the CES data a few days after.</p> <p>On the day before the release, three copies of the report and a CD-ROM are placed in a safe and taken to downtown Washington from the secure location where they were prepared, and presented to the few White House officials who have permission for a sneak peek at the numbers. Journalists are given access to the information 30 minutes before release but have to connect to a secure network that prevents them from sending out the data ahead of its official release.</p> <p> <strong>As nonpartisan as government gets</strong> </p> <p>The BLS is a highly nonpartisan operation, existing since 1884 and <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/senior_staff/galvin.htm"">headed</a> by Jack Galvin, a career employee who ran the employment and unemployment statistics division from 1998 to 2011, and has held a variety of positions there since 1978. Prior to him, Keith Hall headed the agency from 2008 to 2012, following career positions at the Council of Economic Advisors and the International Trade Commission. It?s normal for BLS commissioners to <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/bls/history/commissioners/home.htm"">span administrations and parties</a>. Janet Norwood headed the agency from 1979 to 1991, spanning Carter, Reagan, and Bush I, while her predecessor Julius Shiskin headed it under Nixon, Ford and Carter.</p> <p>Hall has <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/10/05/impossible-to-manipulate-labor-survey-data-former-bls-head/"">told</a> the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>that it is ?impossible? to alter the numbers for political gain. But that hasn?t stopped some from harboring conspiracy theories about their political manipulation. Former GE chief Jack Welch today <a href=""http://twitter.com/jack_welch/status/254198154260525057"">tweeted</a> that ?these Chicago guys will do anything?can?t debate so change numbers,? implying the Obama administration artificially inflated the figures.</p> <p>But presidents themselves have worried about the agency in the past. Richard Nixon infamously <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/whats_the_matter_with_virginia_part_2.html"">asked</a> his aide Fred Malek to count the number of Jews working in BLS, based on his delusion that Jewish liberals were trying to sabotage him through bad jobs numbers.  Suffice it to say, none of these conspiracy theories ? be they anti-semitic or anti-Obama ? have any truth to them.</p> <p> <em>The original version of the post confused benchmark revisions to the CES with ones to the CPS.

Now here are a few other tidbits in the report that you might have missed:</p> <p> <strong> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/OB-UW029_obajob_E_20121005104021.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/OB-UW029_obajob_E_20121005104021.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>1) Obama?s track record on jobs.</strong> Over at the Wall Street Journal, Sudeep Reddy <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/10/05/jobs-under-obama/"">explains</a> that since President Obama took office in January 2009, private non-farm payrolls have risen by 514,000 and government payrolls have dropped by 575,000.</p> <p>Now, if you add in the Bureau of Labor Statistics? <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">preliminary benchmark revisions</a> (which offer an even more accurate look at jobs figures), then the private sector has created 967,000 jobs since Obama took office, while governments at all levels have shed 642,000 jobs.</p> <p> <strong>2) Why last month?s drop in unemployment is unlikely to be a total fluke.</strong> The unemployment rate is calculated from a monthly survey of 60,000 households. As such, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-drops-the-neutron-bomb-on-people-who-think-the-unemployment-rate-was-cooked-2012-10"">it?s likely to be a bit volatile</a>. This month, the household survey showed that 873,000 more Americans were employed in September than in July, with unemployment dropping 0.3 points to 7.8 percent. That could be wrong. But labor economist Betsey Stevenson argues on Twitter that the drop in unemployment is statistically significant. ?A fall of 0.3 may be bigger or smaller than 0.3,? she <a href=""https://twitter.com/BetseyStevenson/status/254238435022344192"">notes</a>, ?but it is a clear fall.? </p> <p>So, although the unemployment rate could tick back up a bit next month, as the household survey data bounces around, the improvement in the labor market in September is very likely to be real. </p> <p> <strong>3) There?s some evidence that business creation is picking up in the United States. </strong>Here?s one theory for why the Bureau of Labor Statistics?s household survey (which showed a big drop in the unemployment rate) looks stronger than the agency?s payroll survey (which showed that the economy only added 114,000 jobs in September). It could be that the payroll survey, which tends to survey established companies and government, is missing an uptick in new business creation.</p> <p>As <a href=""https://twitter.com/jdlahart/status/254218195706195968"">Justin Lahart</a> and economist <a href=""https://twitter.com/justinwolfers/status/254220386181476352"">Justin Wolfers</a> point out, if business creation <em>were</em> picking up, then you?d expect to see a stronger household survey and a big upward revision when the BLS goes through its payroll data more carefully each year. And that?s exactly what happened?by poring through state-level tax data, BLS <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">found an extra 386,000 jobs in March of 2012</a> than it had originally estimated. And the household data is way up. Still, this is just a theory.</p> <p> <strong>4) Manufacturing is weakening, while other sectors are up.</strong> <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/10/americas-jobs-report?fsrc=gn_ep"">Here?s</a> Greg Ip: ?[T]he gains were concentrated in health care, transportation and warehousing, and finance. Manufacturing employment dropped, which corroborates weakness in factory activity that may reflect the slowing global economy and worries about a recession if politicians don?t move the year-end ?fiscal cliff.??</p> <p> <strong>5) Political scientists say this unemployment report probably won?t influence the presidential election.</strong> <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/09/11/how-the-economy-matters-from-here-to-november/"">Here?s a line</a> from Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien, who reviewed 60 years of economic and elections data: ?[O]ne can predict the actual vote from the current income growth about as well in April as in November. By April, the economic cake is largely baked.? John Sides <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/05/todays-jobs-report-will-it-matter-on-election-day/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themonkeycagefeed+%28The+Monkey+Cage%29"">concurs</a> that ?late changes in the economy aren?t that consequential,? although he adds that a strong jobs report might blunt some of Mitt Romney?s recent momentum in the polls.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242a8fbb/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544410538/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a8fbb/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544410538/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a8fbb/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544410538/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a8fbb/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

State governments added 13,000 jobs in September, marking their third straight month of public gains. It?s been a slow recovery for state employees, but the numbers have generally been creeping upwards since December 2011, when state government employment was at its lowest level since the beginning of the recession.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/MN-300x197.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>The gains were concentrated in education, which one would expect employment to increase as we head towards the beginning of the school year. But the numbers are seasonally adjusted, meaning they take that annual bump into account. </p> <p>The improved hiring makes sense as state budgets are finally starting to <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/press-room/state-budget-update-spring-2012.aspx"">recover</a> from the lost revenue and austerity measures they imposed during the recession, particularly after the stimulus money expired. State <a href=""http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/projected-tax-growth-in-fy-2013.aspx"">tax revenues</a> are finally started to come back as business and personal incomes have recovered: State tax collections have risen for the past 10 consecutive quarters, and they?re projected to keep rising in 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.  About a third of states also rely on a real-estate transfer tax that?s also recovering more money as the housing market has started to come back.</p> <p>But overall, public-sector jobs still have a long way to come back, given the severity of government budget cutbacks that have been made. Overall, about 600,000 government jobs have been <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/public-sector-austerity-in-one-graph/2012/06/11/gJQAv89NVV_blog.html"">lost</a> since the beginning of the recession. Local government jobs have recovered somewhat since June ? when the sector hit its lowest level of employment since the beginning of the recession ? but they shed 7,000 jobs between August and September. What?s more, the looming sequester could mean cutbacks in 2013 ? not just on the federal level but on the <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-03/u-dot-s-dot-states-teetering-on-brink-of-fiscal-cliff-ganeriwala-says"">state</a> and local level as well, as the nation?s mayors have warned.</p> <p>*Update: Here?s even more on government job growth from Brookings? Gary Burtless: ?This is the first time since March?May 2010, when the Census Bureau was adding temporary workers for the decennial census, that we have had three successive months in which government employment increased?The latest BLS statistics show that government employment is now adding to rather than subtracting from employment growth.?</p> <p>JPMorgan?s chief economist Michael Feroli delves into the same trend. ? Government employment increased 10,000 last month, and even more surprising, was revised up significantly over the past two months,? he writes. ?The big upward revision came from 91,000 extra government jobs, mostly local education.?</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242a2e7a/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544347111/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a2e7a/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544347111/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a2e7a/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544347111/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242a2e7a/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

How high? Well, Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney at the Hamilton Project, who have done the best work on this, have <a href=""http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/Regardless_of_the_Cost_College_Still_Matters/"">calculated</a> the costs and benefits of going to college from the 1970s to the present. They find that the benefits have gone up steadily each year, while the costs have, contrary to popular belief, not risen quite as fast: </p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/monetarylifetime.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>This means that the annual return on investment has stayed relatively constant for the past 35-odd years at around 17 percent, far more than any conventional investment:</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/ROI.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>Most strikingly of all, the above graphs don?t include financial aid, which has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/14/colleges-payoff-is-declining-unless-you-have-financial-aid/"">skyrocketed</a> over the past few decades. That suggests that the return on investment has actually gone up.</p> <p>Today?s <a href=""http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"" target=""_blank"">jobs report</a> drives the point home. The unemployment rate among those with a bachelor?s degree or higher is 4.1 percent. The rate for high school graduates is 8.7 percent, and for dropouts it?s a staggering 11.3 percent (though this group saw most of the gains this past month). Assuming the returns stay as high as Greenstone and Looney calculate, getting more people into college could push the overall unemployment rate down considerably.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/2429e310/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544344224/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/2429e310/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544344224/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/2429e310/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544344224/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/2429e310/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Case in point, within minutes of the jobs report, Twitter filled with Republicans <a href=""https://twitter.com/jack_welch/status/254198154260525057"">claiming</a> the books were somehow cooked, the numbers aren?t real, etc.</p> <p>Let?s take a deep breath. Jobs reports are about the economy, not about the election. Confusing the two leads to very bad analysis.</p> <p>This is a good jobs report in a still-weak economy. The 114,000 jobs we added in September aren?t very impressive. The revisions to the last two months, which added 86,000 jobs to the total, were much more impressive. Those revisions also suggest that September?s jobs could get revised up ? or, of course, down. So be careful about reading too much into that number. Still, these are, at best, good, not great, numbers.</p> <p>The controversy, if it?s worth using that word, is over the unemployment rate, which dropped from 8.1 percent to 7.8 percent. That?s three-tenths of one percent. That?s what all the fuss is about.</p> <p>Let?s get one thing out of the way: The data was not, as Jack Welch suggested in a now-infamous tweet, manipulated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jobs-day-an-economic-and-political-obsession/2012/03/09/gIQADZPW1R_story.html%20"">set up to ensure the White House has no ability to influence it</a>. As labor economist Betsey Stevenson <a href=""https://twitter.com/betseystevenson/status/254207418182008832"">wrote</a>, ?anyone who thinks that political folks can manipulate the unemployment data are completely ignorant of how the BLS works and how the data are compiled.? Plus, if the White House somehow was manipulating the data, don?t you think they would have made the payroll number look a bit better than 114,000? No one would have batted an eye at 160,000.</p> <p>The fact is that there?s not much that needs to be explained here. We?ve seen drops like this ? and even drops bigger than this ? before. Between July and August the unemployment rate dropped from 8.3 percent to 8.1 percent ? two-tenths of one percent. November-December of 2011 also saw a .2 percent drop. November-December of 2010 saw a .4 percent drop. This isn?t some incredible aberration. The fact that the unemployment rate broke under the psychologically important 8 percent line is making this number feel bigger to people than it really is.</p> <p>The number could, of course, be wrong. The household survey is, well, a survey, which means it?s open to error. But the internals back it up. The number saying they had jobs increased by about 800,000. That seems high, but it?s counting 582,000 who say they got part-time jobs.</p> <p>There?s precedent for this. As Daniel Indiviglio <a href=""https://twitter.com/indiviglio/status/254210775898529792"">notes</a>, part-time jobs increased by 579,000 in September 2010 and by 483,000 in September 2011. It might simply be seasonal hiring. You don?t need to resort to <a href=""https://twitter.com/conncarroll/status/254203443642781697"">ridiculous theories</a> like Democrats across the country suddenly deciding to lie to surveytakers in order to help Obama.</p> <p>Which leads to another argument: That U6, the broadest measure of labor-market pain, didn?t move, which should make us skeptical of the fact that U3, the normal unemployment rate, did move. That?s just misunderstanding what U6 is.</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>U6 is not an unemployment measure. It includes part-time workers who want full-time work. So it doesn?t count the increase in part-time work. But every measure of actual unemployment ? U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5 ? went down. You can see them all <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm"">here</a>. Again, there?s no mystery.</p> <p>This is an encouraging report. What it tells us is that the labor market has been a bit better over the last few months than we thought, and that the recovery hasn?t slowed in the ways we feared. What the response to it tells us is that the election is driving people a little bit crazy. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24296dd8/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544401260/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24296dd8/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544401260/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24296dd8/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544401260/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24296dd8/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

That?s now the lowest level since January 2009. And, for once, the rate fell because Americans are actually finding work?and not just dropping out of the labor force. That?s genuinely good news for an economy that?s still struggling.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/04/19/National-Economy/Images/carpenter.JPG"" /> </p> </p> <p>There are two different numbers used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure the health of the labor market. There?s the payroll survey, which collects data from businesses and government. The headline number here is quite modest, suggesting that the U.S. economy added just 114,000 jobs in September.</p> <p>The truly upbeat part came in the data revisions. As it turns out, those lackluster months of July and August were better than we thought. The agency now says that the U.S. economy added 181,000 jobs in July, rather than 141,000. And it says that the economy added 142,000 jobs in August, rather than a mere 96,000. To be clear, this is still a middling recovery. At this pace, it will take <a href=""http://www.hamiltonproject.org/jobs_gap/"">more than a decade</a> to return to full employment. But at least the economy wasn?t slowing down dramatically over the summer, as originally reported.</p> <p>BLS also publishes the household survey, which <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces_cps_trends.pdf#page=2"" target=""_blank"">asks individuals</a> about their work situation. This is used to calculate the official unemployment rate. And the household numbers were exceptionally strong this month, showing 873,000 more employed Americans in September than in July. That?s a massive boost, and explains why the unemployment rate plunged to 7.8 percent.</p> <p>The employment-to-population ratio also increased by 0.4 percentage points to 58.7 percent. That, too, is an encouraging sign. In the past, the unemployment rate had fallen mainly because more Americans were giving up on searching for work <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-incredible-shrinking-labor-force/2012/05/04/gIQANXAy1T_blog.html"">and dropping out of the labor force</a>. Not this time. The modest improvement appears to be real.</p> <p>So what explains this surge in employment? It?s possible that the jump in this month?s household survey was merely a fluke?the household survey <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces_cps_trends.pdf#page=2"" target=""_blank"">is generally noisier and more volatile</a> than the payroll data. Another possibility is that the increase was driven by a rise in part-time workers, as there are 582,000 more people working part-time this month than last.</p> <p>But before anyone gets ecstatic at the jobs situation, let?s add a few sobering notes of caution. There are still 12.1 million unemployed people in the United States and an additional 2.5 million people who would like jobs but are too discouraged to look. Within that group, there are still 4.8 million people who have been jobless for at least 27 weeks. The labor market is still very, very far from healthy.</p> <p>And, of course, the biggest caveat of all is that these jobs numbers could well be wrong. The monthly payroll numbers tend to get revised in subsequent months as BLS collects fuller data. The July and August jobs reports just got revamped upward by a combined 86,000 jobs. And, in its annual benchmark revision, BLS found that it had essentially been under-counting the number of new jobs <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">by about 30,000 per month</a> between April 2011 and May 2012. This isn?t a conspiracy on the part of government statisticians, as former GE CEO Jack Welch <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-05/former-ge-ceo-jack-welch-says-white-house-manipulates-jobs-data.html"">suggested</a> today. Getting the numbers right is inherently difficult.</p> <p>So this month?s jobs report is encouraging, but we should all be wary of reading too much into any one month?s report.</p> <p> <strong>Related:</strong> </p> <p>? <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/05/the-jobs-report-in-six-charts/"">The jobs report in six charts</a> </p> <p>? The economy added <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/economy-added-386000-more-jobs-last-year-than-we-thought/"">386,000 more jobs last year</a> than we thought.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242919fd/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544336110/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242919fd/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544336110/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242919fd/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544336110/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242919fd/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Unemployment fell 0.3 points to 7.8 percent, and the economy gained 114,000 jobs in September ? and revisions added another 86,000 jobs to the July and August numbers.</p> <p>How does that compare to past months? Let?s find out:</p> <p> <strong>Unemployment and Payroll Numbers</strong> </p> <p>Unemployment took the biggest fall in months, reaching below 8 percent for the first time since January 2009:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_unemployment-payrolls.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_unemployment-payrolls.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p></p> <p> <strong>Labor force participation</strong> </p> <p>That said, the unemployment rate is a function of two things: the number of people employed, and the number of people in the labor force. But the proportion of people in the labor force actually went up, suggesting the fall in the unemployment rate reflects a real improvement, rather than people stopping their work search:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_labor_force.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_labor_force.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>Public and private</strong> </p> <p>Public employment stopped falling for the first time since February. Whereas previous July and August numbers saw it falling, revised numbers suggest that 73,000 public jobs were added in the past three months:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_public_private.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_public_private.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>Alternative Unemployment Measures</strong> </p> <p>As I explained <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/03/the-jobs-report-in-six-nay-seven-charts/http:/www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/the-jobs-report-in-five-charts-2/"">last month</a>, the BLS releases six unemployment measures. There?s U3, the number that shows up in all the news article, which counts people who don?t have jobs, but have looked for one in the past four weeks, but U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 exist as well.  U1 and U2 are usually lower than U3, and measure the percentage of people who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer and the percentage who have lost jobs or done temporary work in the period in question, respectively.</p> <p>U4, U5 and U6 are usually higher than U3. Each of these categories includes everyone in all the lower categories: all people in U3 are in U4, all people in U4 are in U5, and all people in U5 are in U6. U4 adds people who have stopped looking for work because they?ve concluded none is available. U5 adds people who would like to work but for whatever reason have not looked for work recently. U6 adds the underemployed, or part-time workers who want to be working full-time but cannot for whatever reason.</p> <p>The six measures are pretty well coordinated, and all but U6 ticked down in September, suggesting again that the drop reflects real improvement:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/september_alt_unemployment.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p> <strong>Sectors</strong> <br /> </p> <p>Different sectors were hit to varying degrees by the downturn.

At 8:30 a.m., we?ll get the first read on how many jobs the economy created in September. According to the 88 economists <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-05/jobless-rate-probably-climbed-as-u-s-employers-limited-hiring.html"">surveyed</a> by Bloomberg News, the consensus expectation is that we?ll get at about 115,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate might inch up a bit. </p> <p>It?s worth emphasizing that today?s jobs number, whether it?s high or low, is also going to be dead wrong. We?ve been learning the hard way lately that these initial numbers are subject to quite a bit of error. Last week, for instance, we got new data showing the economy had created 386,000 more jobs than we thought between April 2011 and March 2012. That said, the likelihood that a political media hungry for new narratives to impose on the election will stay its hand out of fear of future data revisions is, well, not good.</p> <p> <strong> <em>Top story: Moderate Mitt?</em> </strong> </p> <p> <strong>Meet ?Moderate Mitt,? the man who emerged from Wednesday night?s debate.</strong> ?He used the first presidential debate to speak out forcefully to its wide television audience against the idea of cutting taxes for the wealthy, noting that ?high-income people are doing just fine in this economy.? Asked if there was too much government regulation, he answered, ?regulation is essential.? And he praised the Massachusetts health care bill, calling it a ?model for the nation.? These are all things that President Obama says occasionally on the campaign trail. But in this case, the lines were uttered at the debate Wednesday night in Denver by his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney. Mr. Romney ran to the right in the Republican primaries in 2008 and this year, describing himself this winter as having been a ?severely conservative? governor. This week, he pivoted to the center, as many political analysts had long expected him to do, seeking to appeal to more centrist general election voters. In doing so, Mr. Romney used striking new language to describe his policy proposals on taxes, education and health care in ways that may assuage independent voters ? but which may be sowing confusion about how Mr. Romney would govern.? <em>Michael Cooper, David Kocieniewski, and Jackie Calmes in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/us/politics/entering-stage-right-romney-moved-to-center.html?partner=rss&#38;emc=rss"" target=""_blank"">Politico</a>.</em> </p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/05/wonkbook-the-return-of-moderate-mitt/us-vote-2012-republican-campaign-romney/""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/wonk1005.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/253974310006431744"" target=""_blank"">@sahilkapur</a>: Looks like conservatives have set Romney free.

A good chunk of Iran?s $110 billion foreign exchange reserves <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/world/middleeast/irans-rial-plummets-against-the-dollar.html?hp"">is locked up</a> in offshore accounts that are now frozen. Overseas banks have been barred from doing business with Iran?s central bank. And Iran is having trouble selling its oil abroad. Add it all up, and those sanctions have restricted the supply of dollars and other foreign currency reaching Iran.</p> <p>This has made it extremely difficult for Iran?s central bank to maintain its currency peg of 12,260 rials to the dollar. Individuals and businesses are instead buying up scarce dollars and euros on the black market, often to pay for imports. As more Iranians try to trade their rials for (increasingly rare) foreign currency, dollars get pricier and the value of the rial drops.</p> <p>That problem finally exploded last month. In the black markets, the value of Iran?s rial has now plunged 65 percent in the past few weeks.

The country?s monthly inflation rate, Hanke estimates, is now 69.6 percent. That?s hyperinflation territory.</p> <p>What triggered last month?s sudden collapse? That?s not yet clear. One <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/world/middleeast/irans-rial-plummets-against-the-dollar.html?hp"">explanation</a> is that the Iranian government set up official ?currency centers? to sell dollars at a discount to businesses that import, say, meat or grain or medicine. The idea was to ration out foreign currency to those who need it most. But the move may have stoked widespread panic that the government was running out of dollars, triggering a run on the rial.</p> <p>Iran?s hyperinflation isn?t yet on par with the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/21/great-hyperinflation-episodes-in-history-and-what-they-tell-us-about-the-fed/"">most out-of-control episodes in history</a>?such as Hungary in 1945 or Zimbabwe in 2007. But it?s a reminder that hyperinflation is usually a problem that plagues countries hit by a severe external shock, rather than a result of, say, quantitative easing.</p> <p>The Christian Science Monitor <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/1004/Iran-s-currency-Why-did-the-rial-tumble-so-precipitously/(page)/2"">has more</a> on how Iran found itself in this situation, noting that the country?s atrophied private sector and the government?s failure to build up sufficient foreign reserves has made the country extremely vulnerable to currency speculation. Over at FT Alphaville, Izabella Kaminska <a href=""http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/10/03/1190441/greshams-law-takes-iran/"">also delves</a> into Iran?s woes, noting: ?At this point, Iran is running out of options.

Gerald Ford saying, ?There is no Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe.? Ronald Reagan saying, ?There you go again.? Al Gore sighing. And sighing. And sighing.</p> <p>Those moments matter because they become the shorthand for the media?s subsequent discussion of the debate. But it was hard for me to think of any definitional moments, for either candidate, in last night?s debate. Almost everyone ? myself included ? thought Obama came off listless and unprepared. He clearly lost the night. But he didn?t make any big mistakes. Romney, by contrast, was aggressive and quick on his feet. But, more so than Obama, he might come to regret a few of the things he said. </p> <p>There was a point in the debate, for instance, when Romney repeatedly insisted his Medicare reforms wouldn?t touch current seniors. ?If you?re 60 or around 60 or older, you don?t need to listen any further,? he said with a smile. ?Again,? he said a moment later, ?that?s for future people, right, not for current retirees.?</p> <p>This is standard Republican fare, but it comes off rather badly, I think. When you keep saying that you wouldn?t dare impose your plan on current retirees, it doesn?t exactly signal that this is the kind of plan that people are actually going to like. </p> <p>There was also an exchange over the tax break for moving companies overseas. Romney denied its existence. ?Look, I?ve been in business for 25 years,? he said. ?I have no idea what you?re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.?</p> <p>If Obama had been a better debater, the ?I maybe need to get a new accountant? line, given Romney?s unusually low tax rate, could have been devastating. As it is, I?d expect to see it in ads soon. And, for the record, that tax break really does exist, though it?s not specifically for firms that move overseas. As Reuters <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/04/us-usa-campaign-check-idUSBRE89307P20121004"">explains</a>, ?What Obama was actually describing was a tax break for ordinary business expense, including deductions allowed for a company if it closes its plant in the United States and moves it to another country.?</p> <p>But insofar as the debate had any defining exchanges, it was the 40-minute back-and-forth in which Obama accused Romney of proposing a $5 trillion tax cut, Romney forswore any such plan, Obama insisted Romney did have that plan, Romney replied he would never even consider such a thing, etc and so on. The truth is that Romney has proposed a tax cut that would cost $5 trillion, but he?s promised to figure out how to pay for it at some later date. Whether you think Romney should get credit for that promise is up to you. But the Obama campaign clearly thinks that that moment represents a vulnerability for Romney:</p> <p></p> <p>Ouch.</p> <p>Conversely, Romney?s Web site doesn?t have any new ads up using debate clips, which confirms my sense that while Obama didn?t acquit himself particularly well, he didn?t say anything the Romney campaign sees much upside in jumping on.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign is nevertheless feeling very good today, as they should. Almost 60 million people <a href=""http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/debate-ratings-fox-news-tops-cable-news-for-first-debate-as-more-people-tune-in-than-2008_b148739#more-148739"">watched</a> last night?s debate. That means Romney?s best night of the campaign happened before the single largest audience of the campaign. No ad the Obama team can release will be nearly as widely viewed. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242220c6/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544340834/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242220c6/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544340834/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242220c6/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544340834/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242220c6/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

So here are some of the more thoughtful estimates from the election wonks.</p> <p> <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/04/how-much-will-the-debate-shift-the-polls-heres-one-calculation/?utm_source=feedburner&#38;utm_medium=feed&#38;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themonkeycagefeed+%28The+Monkey+Cage%29"">John Sides</a>: ?Let?s assume that the same fraction of undecided voters shift in Romney?s direction as shifted in Bush?s direction.  In 2000, that was 25 percent of undecideds (3/12=.25).  In 2012, the proportion of undecideds is about 5 percent.  So 25 percent of 5 percent is 1.25 points?about what I predicted last night.  It could end up being a bit more, if you think that Obama has been out-performing the fundamentals of the race, and thus we were due for a course correction.?</p> <p> <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/polls-show-a-strong-debate-for-romney/"">Nate Silver</a>: ?It seems likely that Mr. Romney will make at least some gains in head-to-head polls after the debate, and entirely plausible that they will be toward the high end of the historical range, in which polls moved by about three percentage points toward the candidate who was thought to have the stronger debate.?</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108124/did-romney-reshape-the-race"">Nate Cohn</a>: ?Regardless of whether Romney has upended the race, he can expect something of a bounce in the post-debate polls. Following the first debate in 2004, Kerry closed to within 1.6 points in the RCP average, compared to his final 2.4-point defeat. Four years earlier still, Bush seized the lead in post-debate polls and didn?t relinquish it until the Election Day results showed Gore winning the popular vote?the key questions are whether Obama falls far beneath 49 percent and whether Romney can get past 47. If neither of these conditions are met, then Romney?s performance just wasn?t good enough.?</p> <p>It?s also worth remembering what political scientists Robert Erikson and Chistopher Wlezien <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Timeline-Presidential-Elections-Campaigns/dp/0226922154/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#38;qid=1349323515&#38;sr=8-1&#38;keywords=the+timeline+of+presidential+elections"">found</a> after reviewing every public poll taken before and after every televised debate: ?the best prediction from the debates is the initial verdict before the debates.?</p> <p>Overall, I?d expect the polls to tighten, perhaps even substantially. But how much they tighten will be very telling. Wednesday was as good a night as Romney can expect to have in the rest of this campaign, in front of as big an audience as he?ll get, with a maximum of media coverage. So his bounce will help tell us how many voters really remain persuadable, or at least how many of the persuadable voters are paying attention to the final events of the campaign. If that number is high, Romney should close the gap substantially, if not pull slightly ahead. If it?s low, he won?t see much bounce, and it will be that much harder to see his path to victory. </p> <p>Think about the people you know: How many of the Obama voters who thought Romney won the debate seem ready to change their vote today? Personally, I don?t know any Obama voters who thought he won the debate. But I also don?t know any Obama voters who have said they?re now supporting Romney. Now, my circles are unusually politically active, and so their preferences are unusually hard to move. But remember that the most persuadable voters pay the least attention to politics, so they may not know or care that Obama lost a debate. The polls, in other words, will quickly tell us whether Obama simply looked bad or whether he lost real support.</p> <p>The second question, of course, will be whether the bounce persists. This is the first of three presidential debates. It?s possible all of them will be lopsided victories for Romney, but unlikely. The expectations game now is such that Obama won?t have to do that much better, and Romney won?t have to do that much worse, for Obama?s next performance to be graded more favorably. That?s basically what happened with the Bush-Kerry debates in 2004, and it helped Bush recover after his weak initial performance. So just as with the conventions, keep in mind that it will be very hard to say what effect ?the debates? had until they?re actually over.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242166bf/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275564/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166bf/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275564/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166bf/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544275564/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166bf/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

It also suggests that you should expect the Fed to declare at its next meeting a level of unemployment we?d need to reach for them to start tightening again. Here are some highlights.</p> <p> <strong>There was broad consensus on buying more assets</strong> </p> <p>Most committee members believed that buying new assets could ?provide support to the economic recovery by putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.? And most also thought that buying mortgage-backed securities would be better than Treasuries. ?Some participants suggested that, all else being equal, MBS purchases could be preferable because they would more directly support the housing sector?One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors.?</p> <p>There were a few doubters, who ?expressed skepticism that additional policy accommodation could help spur an economy that they saw as held back by uncertainties and a range of structural issues.? Another worried that more asset buys ?could lead to excessive risk-taking on the part of some investors and so undermine financial stability over time.? But most participants noted that the Fed can always change the amount of assets they?re buying, and so negate these costs.</p> <p> <strong>But participants disagreed on tying policy to unemployment</strong> </p> <p>Some, like Columbia?s <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/15/michael-woodford-i-personally-would-have-gone-further-but-what-the-fed-did-is-definitely-a-step-in-the-right-direction/"">Michael Woodford</a>, have criticized the Fed for not tying policy to an explicit measure of economic health, such as the level of nominal GDP or the unemployment rate. The minutes suggest these critics have allies within the Fed: ?Many participants thought that more-effective forward guidance could be provided by specifying numerical thresholds for labor market and inflation indicators that would be consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels.?</p> <p>They argued this would provide greater clarity about the Fed?s future actions. These members <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/20/low-rates-until-unemployment-hits-5-5-a-fed-official-gives-his-plan-for-liftoff/"">likely included</a> Chicago Fed president Charles Evans, who has argued that the Fed should keep rates low until unemployment is below 7 percent or inflation is above 3, and Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota, who has proposed targets of 5.5 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively.</p> <p>But the members couldn?t agree on what those targets should be, and ?some were reluctant to specify explicit numerical thresholds out of concern that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process.? They concluded by agreeing that thresholds were useful, but that ?further work would be needed? to flesh out exactly which to use. So look out for a rule like Evans? or Kocherlakota?s at the next Fed meeting.</p> <p> <strong>They disagree about uncertainty</strong> </p> <p>Just like <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/08/how-do-we-know-if-we-have-a-policy-uncertainty-problem/"">economists outside the bank</a>, FOMC members disagreed about whether uncertainty regarding government policies, Europe, and other factors is slowing down the economy. ?Many participants?noted that a high level of uncertainty regarding the European fiscal and banking crisis and the outlook for U.S. fiscal and regulatory policies was weighing on confidence, thereby restraining household and business spending. however, others questioned the role of uncertainty as a factor constraining aggregate demand.?</p> <p> <strong>They disagree about what?s keeping unemployment high</strong> </p> <p>While the best economic evidence <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/06/bill-clinton-says-the-unemployed-dont-have-the-right-skills-its-not-so/"">suggests</a> that unemployment is high because people aren?t spending money, not because workers don?t have the right skills, many on the FOMC seem to disagree:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>?A few participants reiterated their view that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the effect of structural factors, including mismatches across and within sectors between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available. It was also suggested that there was an ongoing process of polarization in the labor market, with the share of job opportunities in middle-skill occupations continuing to decline while the shares of low and high skill occupations increased. Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.?</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>There is <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/04/why-so-many-jobless-recoveries-its-the-robots/"">some evidence</a> for the polarization hypothesis, but the rest seems just wrong. Other discussion participants disputed the structural account, and noted that worse structural problems could arise if people remain unemployed and can?t keep up with employed workers in terms of skills:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>Several participants, while acknowledging some evidence of structural changes in the labor market, stated again that weak aggregate demand was the principal reason for the high unemployment rate. They saw slack in resource utilization as remaining wide, indicating an important role for additional policy accommodation. Several participants noted the risk that continued high levels of unemployment, even if initially cyclical, might ultimately induce adverse strucutral changes.</p> <p> In particular, they expressed concerns about the risk that the exceptionally high level of long-term unemployment and the depressed level of labor participation could ultimately lead to permanent negative effects on the skills and prospects of those without jobs, thereby reducing the longer-run normal level of employment and potential output.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Translation: if we don?t fix unemployment now, we?re going to have fewer jobs and weaker growth for decades to come.</p> <p> <strong>Most people weren?t worried about inflation</strong> </p> <p>Participants largely agreed that inflation wouldn?t go above the 2 percent target the Fed has set: ?With longer-term inflation expectations stable and the unemployment rate elevated, participants generally anticipated that inflation over the medium run would likely run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate.?</p> <p>But a few participants worried that extended loose policy from the Fed could change that: ?A few participants felt that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over an extended period?posed upside risks to inflation. Other participants, by contrast, saw inflation risks as tilted to the downside, given their expectations for sizable and persistent resource slack.?</p> <p> <strong>Everyone?s worried about the fiscal cliff</strong> </p> <p>FOMC members generally agreed that if we go over the ?fiscal cliff? come year?s end, with big tax increases and budget cuts set to take effect, the results would be harmful to the economy: ?Participants generally expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic activity over coming quarters?Participants?noted that if an agreement was not reached to tackle the existing tax cuts and scheduled spending reductions, a sharp consolidation of fiscal policy would take place at the beginning of 2013.? </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/242166be/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275563/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166be/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544275563/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166be/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544275563/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/242166be/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Here?s why he?s wrong.","3","-1","0","","2012-10-04 16:41:30","<p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_404h/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/on-small-business/Images/gina%20porto%20carnivore.JPG"" /> </p> </p> <p>In the tax portion of last night?s debate, Mitt Romney repeatedly claimed that President Obama will raise taxes on small businesses. ?Fifty-four percent of America?s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate,? he <a href=""http://apps.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcripts/2012/presidential/live/739/?hpid=z2"">argued</a>. ?And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.?</p> <p>Obama replied that 97 percent of businesses who pay individual rates wouldn?t see their taxes go up. But Romney disputed the relevance of that figure. ?But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half ? half of all the people who work in small business,? he argued. ?Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.?</p> <p>So who?s right? First, the 97 percent figure is if anything an underestimate. According to the <a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3031&#38;topic2ID=60&#38;topic3ID=94&#38;DocTypeID=7"">Tax Policy Center</a>, in 2011 only 1.4 percent of individual filers reporting ?business income? paid the top 33 percent or 35 percent tax rates. The other 98.6 percent either paid the Alternative Minimum Tax (which Obama would <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/03/16/study-buffett-rule-is-no-substitute-for-amt/"">replace</a> with the Buffett rule) or else paid taxes at lower rates, which Obama has said he won?t alter.</p> <p>That said, the 447,000 households paying top rates on business income tend to get more of their income from businesses than those in lower brackets do:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/businessincome_agi.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/businessincome_agi.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>Does this mean 44.5 percent of high-income people own their own small businesses? Not at all. As Derek Thompson <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/08/the-facts-about-small-business-and-the-bush-tax-cut/61023/"">explained</a> when this debate popped up two years ago, ?business income? could include speaking fees, side income from selling wood carvings, part-time consulting, partnership in a law firm and any number of other activities that most wouldn?t categorize as ?owning a small business.?</p> <p>The Treasury Department had some researchers <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/OTA-T2011-04-Small-Business-Methodology-Aug-8-2011.pdf"" target=""_blank"">try to figure out</a> what true small business owners make. It turns out that many of them make nowhere near enough to pay top rates. Only 11 percent of small business owners made more than $200,000, and only 8 percent of small business owners who got at least a quarter of their income that way made that much. Only 4 percent of true small business owners were at the 33 or 35 percent brackets, and would see their taxes go up under Obama.</p> <p>The portion of small business owners paying those rates goes up if you only look at ?employers? ? that is, people whose small businesses had labor costs of over $10,000. Of those people, 10 percent paid the 33 percent and 35 percent rates. But given that there were only five million small business owners with employees under this definition, that amounts to 500,000 people getting a tax increase: hardly a huge change.</p> <p>What about Romney?s claim that businesses with high-earning owners employ more people ? 54 percent, by his estimate? This figure comes from <a href=""http://www.s-corp.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Flow-Through-Report-Final-2011-04-08.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Robert Carroll and Gerald Prante</a> at the accounting firm Ernst and Young. But this figure includes all income to ?flow-through corporations? ? that is, corporations whose profits are passed along to owners and taxed at normal income tax rates. It thus includes flow-through corporations whose owners pay high rates (such as highly profitable software companies), as well as those that pay much lower rates (such as someone with a part-time freelance consulting businesses). Romney very seriously mischaracterized the population to which this number refers.</p> <p>So will Obama?s tax plan depress hiring among firms organized this way? That?s less clear.  Suppose I?m a small business owner who makes $1 million a year and has $200,000 in payroll. If I fired someone making $100,000 in total compensation today, that would increase my income to $1.1 million, and my after-tax income by $65,000, after I take the top rate of 35 percent off.</p> <p>Now suppose we?re using Obama?s rates. That same firing would only get me $60,400, because of the higher 39.6 percent top rate. So a higher marginal tax rate actually lowers the incentive to fire people and makes hiring look more appealing. Of course, businesses usually hire with the hope that profits go up, and they?ll be less likely to do that with higher marginal rates. But the overall effect on incentives is far from clear.</p> <p>So Romney is right that some small business owners will pay a higher tax rate under Obama?s plan. But that amounts to only 500,000 people, with only about 652,000 employees. The vast majority of small business owners and employees won?t be affected. What?s more, those who are affected might have more reason to hire.</p> <p> <em>Note: the original version of this post misread part of a Treasury table to get an estimate of the number of employees affected by changes in individual rates. It appears there isn?t a reliable estimate from a reputable, so that section has been excise. We apologize for the error.</em> </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24205e48/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544271054/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24205e48/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544271054/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24205e48/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544271054/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24205e48/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

What?s more, you might get the impression that ?this housing crisis is over,? <a href=""http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/10/the-first-presidential-debate/"">writes</a> Jed Kolko, chief economist for Trulia, a real-estate search service.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/help-foreclosure-housing-300x220.jpeg"" /> </p> </p> <p>When housing did come up, Kolko says, it was in the context of how the market has come back (Obama: ?housing has begun to rise?) or how to prevent the next housing crisis through stricter mortgage lending standards (one part of Dodd-Frank that Romney says that he likes).</p> <p>It?s true that there has been a lot of progress made: nationwide, the foreclosure rate is down and home sales have jumped up. But given the severity of the housing crisis, that only puts us<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/florida-foreclosure-inventory-rises-2012-10""> 42 percent</a> of the way back to a housing recovery, according to Kolko?s housing <a href=""http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/09/housing-market-leaps-to-42-back-to-normal/"">barometer</a>; as of August, construction spending was only 27 percent of the way back to normal. And despite <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/business/economy/slow-response-to-housing-crisis-now-weighs-on-obama.html?pagewanted=all"">expanded</a> government refinancing programs, many homeowners are still struggling with payments and remain <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/florida-foreclosure-inventory-rises-2012-10"">at risk</a> of losing their homes.</p> <p>But each candidate had an obvious political motivation not to broach the subject: Obama himself has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/business/economy/slow-response-to-housing-crisis-now-weighs-on-obama.html?pagewanted=all"">admitted</a> that his administration didn?t do enough, quickly enough, to respond to the housing crisis.

Instead, she turned over her crayon to Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin quickly decided that if Barack Obama couldn&rsquo;t suffice as his candidate in a presidential debate, he&rsquo;d call upon a fictional president, Jed Bartlet, for some advice. Thus, an asinine conversation between a TV president and &hellip; well &hellip; a TV president ensued.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And it channeled exactly what most liberals thought of Obama&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dowd-two-presidents-smoking-and-scheming.html?hp"">debate performance</a>:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET </strong>Were you sleepy?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> Jed &mdash;</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> Was that the problem? Had you just taken allergy medication? General anesthesia?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> I had an off night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> What makes you say that? The fact that the Cheesecake Factory is preparing an ad campaign boasting that it served Romney his pre-debate meal? Law school graduates all over America are preparing to take the bar exam by going to the freakin&rsquo; Cheesecake Factory!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> <em>(following Bartlet inside)</em> I can understand why you&rsquo;re upset, Jed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> Did your staff let you know the debate was gonna be on television?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The left is incensed that Obama did so poorly, and so is Sorkin. Instead of comparing Obama&rsquo;s debate performance to past performances off-teleprompter &ndash; a comparison which would show undeniably that Obama wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;off his game,&rdquo; he never had any game &ndash; Sorkin suggests medication. Which, of course, Sorkin knows a good deal about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA </strong><em>(looking in the other room)</em> Is that Jeff Daniels?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> That&rsquo;s Will McAvoy, he just looks like Jeff Daniels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>OBAMA</strong> Why&rsquo;s he got Jim Lehrer in a hammerlock?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>BARTLET</strong> That&rsquo;s called an Apache Persuasion Hold. McAvoy thinks it&rsquo;s the responsibility of the moderator to expose &mdash; what are they called? &mdash; lies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>WILL</strong> <em>(shouting)</em> Did Obama remove the work requirement from Welfare-to-Work?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><strong>LEHRER</strong> No!</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><strong>WILL</strong> And you didn&rsquo;t want to ask Romney about that because? It would&rsquo;ve been impolite?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next liberal trope: it&rsquo;s Lehrer&rsquo;s fault. No, it wasn&rsquo;t. Romney did just fine challenging Obama&rsquo;s lies. Obama had a rough time challenging Romney&rsquo;s truths. As for Obama gutting Welfare-to-Work &hellip; he did <a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/09/welfare-work-requirements-vague-replacement-of-work-for-welfare"">exactly that</a>. But the column goes on in this idiotic fashion, suggesting that Romney lied about a non-existent $5 trillion tax cut (even Stephanie Cutter admitted that there was no such tax cut), that Romney lied about Obama raising taxes (even Joe Biden said he would), that Romney lied when he said that Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare (he did), doubled the deficit (he actually <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2012/02/16/obamas-budget-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-american-economy/"">doubled the national debt</a>, not the deficit), etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Liberals are still living in the past, hoping that Bill Clinton will somehow inhabit the body of Barack Obama. But now they&rsquo;re also living in a fictional past, with a fictional president. Here&rsquo;s the dirty little secret about Jed Bartlet: he never faced real opposition, or a real economy. All of it was scripted by Aaron Sorkin. If he&rsquo;d been a real president, he&rsquo;d look a lot like Obama. And he&rsquo;d have been trounced, too.</p>

That having been said, BuzzFeed's Zeke Miller perpetrated one of the worst attempts at guilt by association ever made. Miller attempted to intimate that Mitt Romney is a racist because his motorcade drove past private property that had a Confederate flag flying on it as he campaigned in Virginia.
</p>
<p>You read that right. All Romney did was sit in a car that <em>drove past</em> a Confederate flag and that was something that Miller thought was ""news.""
</p>
<p>Miller made this trenchant observation on his <a href=""https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/254238218126503936"">Twitter feed</a> on October 5.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romney motorcade just passed a hill flying a large confederate flag in rural SW VA
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. Imagine, driving past a Confederate flag in a state that makes millions in tourist money off its intimate connection to American history! Imagine the sheer luck of finding a Confederate flag flying in the one state most associated with the Civil War! Why, the absolute craziness of finding a Confederate flag flying in the state that hosted the Capitol of the Confederate States of America!
</p>
<p>What are the chances?
</p>
<p>And that darn Romney? Shame on him for purposefully sitting in a car that sought out Confederate scenery to drive past. Why, it's proof of any manner of racism. Heck, that car may well have been covered in a white sheet.
</p>
<p>But, maybe Mr. Observant was trying to enrich all our understanding of the lives of the candidates on the road? Maybe he made the same sort of intellectual observations about candidate Obama?
</p>
<p>Ace of Spades wondered that, too and <a href=""http://ace.mu.nu/archives/333549.php"">took a look</a> to see what Zeke ""The Watcher"" Miller had to say about Obama's campaign journey.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pool: Obama insisted on taking a photograph in front of the sign that read ""Michelle's Bakery.""
    </li>
    <li>Obama per pool: "" And she spells it the right way, with two Ls. That&rsquo;s the correct way""
    </li>
    <li>Pool: ""Potus seemed enamored by the shop's name. ""It is no coincidence that I&rsquo;m stopping at Michelle&rsquo;s bakery,""</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the hard-hitting observations that will expose Obama as&hellip; er&hellip; a lover of bakeries named after his wife?
</p>

</p>
<p>Speaking at the offices of the Metro Newspaper in New York where he was acting as a ""global guest editor,"" Branson said that he was part of a commission that spent two years looking at the war on drugs and they came to the conclusion that it is ""<a href=""http://www.metro.us/newyork/national/article/1153435--branson-labels-us-drugs-policy-racist"">patently obvious it's failed</a>.""
</p>
<p>Branson noted that other nations, like Portugal, have made changes to their policies that have helped alleviate their drug problems and suggested that the U.S. follow suit.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>When asked if the U.S. is different, Branson went on a tirade of sorts claiming that the American war on drugs will be harder to change for the better because it's all about racism.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I'll tell you what's different. I'll tell you what the fundamental difference in America is, it, it is a war against black people in America. It's black people that 85 percent of people who go to prison in America for taking drugs is black people. They don't take more drugs, but it's a racist law against black people in America.""
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>""The law should be changed,"" Branson insisted. ""You&rsquo;ve got something like 1.5 million people in American jails languishing for taking drugs and that is wrong. Those people would be much better being out in society, being helped if they have drug problems, getting off the problem.""

</p>
<p>In an interview on NBC's <em>Today</em> show, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed his amazement on the achievement. It's ""just unbelievable,"" said Zuckerberg.
</p>
<p>Facebook and other social media outlets have changed the way we interact, indeed.
</p>
<p>With the watch word of ""be careful what you say,"" all too often what appears on the Internet is hard to erase and relationships and family interaction is frequently marred by hasty social media posts.
</p>
<p>Perhaps even a new form of discrimination is in the offing. Employers are increasingly turning to Facebook, Twitter and the Internet generally to <a href=""http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/04/18/survey-37-of-your-prospective-employers-are-looking-you-up-on-facebook/"">screen out prospective employees</a> before ever even meeting them. Some employers have even taken to requiring prospective employees to hand over passwords to social media accounts so that a review of what the interviewee has posted can be undertaken.
</p>
<p>In any case, as social media grows and new tools are made for its use, more changes are on the way. For now, Facebook's one billion users makes quite a social network.

For twenty years, all 50 states have been reported, but somehow this year the networks and AP are ignoring 19 of them.&nbsp; Now just how and why were those 19 states selected?</p>
<p>The ostensible reason given is the rising cost of the surveys. Dan Merkle, director of elections for ABC News, and a member of the consortium that runs the polls, said the goal &ldquo;is to still deliver a quality product in the most important states.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So just which states are being ignored?&nbsp; Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p>
<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> tried to gloss over the scheme, noting &ldquo;how carefully the exit poll planners allocated resources. All 19 of the states with no exit polls are classified as either &ldquo;solid Obama&rdquo; or &ldquo;solid Romney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? Of the nineteen states (including Washington, D.C.) exactly <em>4</em> are for Obama, with a total of 14 electoral votes. The fifteen Romney states add up to <em>135.</em></p>
<p>It is utter hogwash that the exit polls were cut from these states because they were in the bag for one of the candidates. If Texas is cut, how about New York and California? </p>
<p>The real reason the consortium has cut these states is that they know that if they report fifteen states coming in for Romney early, independent voters in other states will take notice and be swayed his way.</p>
<p>There is no way that the networks and AP can rationalize their decision without damning themselves with their obvious partisanship. In 2008, the major media outlets were in the tank and lined up for Obama, but it was done under the radar. Now it&rsquo;s all-encompassing. They are goose-stepping in public.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/BS2TP0bNXzg"" width=""1"" />"

<p>MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell grabbed hold of the Obama talking points this morning and attempted to hit Obama surrogate John Sununu with them. The result was the second epic loss for the left in as many days. </p>
<p>You can savor the clip below:</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>...and the corrupt media claims calling a lazy president lazy is racist in 5... 4... 3...</p>
<p>The hustle the media's working here is in the attempt to weaponize&nbsp;the specifics they need to beat Romney&nbsp;to death with.&nbsp;And keep in mind that this is the very&nbsp;same media that got all leg tingley over that detailed two-point&nbsp;2008 plan Obama liked to call&nbsp;""hoping"" and ""changing."" </p>
<p>Romney is exactly right to run on principal without offering up the kind of specifics that Congress will declare dead on arrival. You need room to negotiate. That's how things get done. In 1980, Reagan didn't offer up specifics and that seemed to turn out pretty well. </p>
<p>It's just a fact that we don't vote for presidents based on the wonk; we vote for them based on&nbsp;ideas, ideals, vision, character, and principle. </p>
<p>Furthermore, no one's asking the all-time loser of last night's debate for more details. But that may be because we already know the ""details."" </p>
<p>After all, Obama's only promising more of the same of what failed so miserably these last four years. </p>

It's just a fact that Obama has failed at absolutely everything he's touched -- the stimulus, foreign policy, cash for clunkers, green jobs, the economy, and most especially job creation. Oh, and he sucks so hard at debating that the best one of the worst flaks in media could do was to attempt to <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/04/Stephanopoulos-embarrasses-himself-spins-debate-as-tie"">call last night a draw</a>. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Last night's debate loss was huge, which means Obama's Media Palace Guards are desperate to find a win for the President as quickly as possible. Today's new <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/04/Jobless-Claims-Spike-Stuck-In-Neutral"">jobless numbers</a> certainly didn&rsquo;t fit the bill, but tomorrow's monthly jobs report just might. But like I said, Obama sucks at job creation, which is why the media grades him on such a pathetic curve and is already pre-spinning a win. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">More than once, on CNN and elsewhere, the media is apparently setting the bar for an Obama job creation-win at a paltry, pathetic 100,000. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">""If it's over 100,000 jobs created, that's a win for Obama. If it's under 100,000, that's a loss,"" a CNN analyst said in so many words earlier today. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Only our pathetically corrupt media would consider 100,000 jobs created a month anything but a disaster. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For the sake of context, let's look at what 100,000 jobs mean:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Just for starters, if we're to keep up with population growth, the economy needs to generate anywhere from <a href=""http://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/calculator/index.cfm"">105,000 to 125,000 jobs a month</a>. If all we do is cover this nut, we're treading water. In order to actually create a net-plus number of jobs, we have to do much better than the 100,000 number the media will attempt to paint as victory tomorrow. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Moreover, let's compare Obama's job creation numbers to those of another president who also ""inherited"" a mess -- Ronald Reagan. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">As we all know, Reagan and Obama went about solving the country's economic woes in two entirely different ways. Obama squandered almost a trillion dollars on a stimulus and pushed the federal government into every part of the free market -- from health care to the auto industry. Reagan dramatically lowered taxes and got government out of the American people's way. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In return, under Obama, our economy is shrinking, job creation is below the increase in population, and the deficit looms like a giant meteor headed right&nbsp; for our children and grand children. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Reagan, however, exploded economic growth, kept the deficit manageable, and created jobs -- lots of them. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here are some more apples to apples: At this exact moment in Reagan's presidency (<a href=""http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet"">the 1984 American economy</a> between June and November), created&nbsp; 379k, 312k, 241k, 311k, 286k, and 349k jobs, respectively. It's also worth noting our population was smaller at this time, so the nut to stay ahead was smaller. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">By comparison, not only is the media trying to tell us that a totally unacceptable 100,000 jobs number will be a win&nbsp;for this failed president, but take a look at Obama's job creation this year between the months of June through August: June: <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/07/06/summer-bummer-june-jobs-report-disappoints-at-80k"">80k</a>, July: <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/08/03/Public-Radio-s-Marketplace-Unemployment-Rises-A-Really-Good-Jobs-Report"" target=""_blank"">163k</a>, August: <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/08/173k-food-stamps-96k-new-jobs"">96K</a>&nbsp;(and the June and July numbers together were revised downward by <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/07/Devasting-jobs-report-sept-2012"" target=""_blank"">41k</a>).</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">So only in the media's manufactured reality will 100k jobs created during the entire month of September be anything close to acceptable -- especially after three previous months of not breaking even with population&nbsp;growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But as we already know, the media doesn&rsquo;t care about the poor or the jobless or any American suffering under Obama's failures. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">All they care about is pulling a president promising nothing more than four more years of failure over the finish line based on no higher qualification than the fact he has a ""D"" after his name. </p>

But as to exactly <em>why</em> the President was so taciturn, lackadaisical, distracted, and downright peevish, the media's consensus was, in many cases, silly. In fact, a number of the President's supporters are actually blaming debate moderator, 78-year-old Jim Lehrer.
</p>
<p>The voice closest to the President is that of campaign adviser and TV flack Stephanie Cutter, who was quick to dismiss Lehrer as an unnecessary part of the event. Ladling out her usual blather, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/obamas-cutter-takes-swipe-at-lehrer-137444.html"">Cutter told CNN</a> that ""we feel pretty good about the President's performance here tonight,"" but went on to take a swipe at Lehrer. ""I sometimes wondered if we even needed a moderator because we had Mitt Romney,"" she said.
</p>
<p>But Cutter <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2012/10/04/tough-reviews-for-jim-lehrer-as-debate-moderator"">wasn't alone</a>. HBO's Bill Maher was as blunt as he usually is on his Twitter feed. ""Lehrer sucked,"" he carped.
</p>
<p>Sherri Shepherd, of ABC's <em>The View</em>, tweeted that someone should ""throw a spitball"" at Lehrer.
</p>
<p>The Huffington Post's main Twitter feed wasn't too happy about Lehrer's work, either, saying: ""Mitt Romney and Barack Obama moderated this debate. Where was Jim Lehrer?""
</p>
<p>In her post-debate wrap up on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow said that Romney spent a lot of time battling both the President <em>and</em> Lehrer. ""Romney won every exchange,"" she noted ruefully.
</p>
<p>Maddow had <a href=""http://www.mediaite.com/tv/maddow-no-winner-in-this-debate-but-there-is-a-loser-jim-lehrer/"">other words</a> for Lehrer, too. ""I do believe that we saw this debate format die a very painful death on camera tonight... the format and, I think, the moderator, honestly, with all due respect to Jim Lehrer,"" she said.
</p>
<p>Normally mild-mannered Al Roker of NBC's <em>Today</em> <a href=""https://twitter.com/alroker/status/253683154756448257"">took a shot at Lehrer</a> on his own Twitter feed. ""I hope Jim Lehrer gets the license plate of the truck that drove over him in this debate,"" he joked.
</p>
<p>Some wag even started a new Twitter account with the name ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/silentjimlehrer"">Silent Jim Lehrer</a>.""
</p>
<p>Speaking of Twitter, Poynter has a <a href=""http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/190523/jim-lehrer-target-of-media-criticism-while-moderating-his-12th-presidential-debate/"">nice rundown of jabs and slams</a> of moderator Lehrer from such celebrities as Conan O'Brien, Bill Maher, the Onion, Michael Moore, various news folks and others, all slamming Lehrer as the man who wasn't there.
</p>
<p>It is pretty amusing, if not a bit ironic, that all these leftists are attacking a card-carrying member of the left-wing media, isn't it? The left loves the Old Media until it does something they feel is counter to their narrative. In this case, though, it's like blaming a referee because a team lost by three touchdowns.
</p>
<p>Some reports earlier this year claimed the debate commission had to <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/us/criticism-greets-list-of-debate-moderators.html?_r=2&amp;ref=politics"">coax Lehrer out of retirement</a> to do this debate. He initially refused to do it but eventually relented and accepted the role. One might guess that Lehrer won't make the mistake of leaving retirement for a debate again.
</p>
<p>Finally, for his part, former Vice President Al Gore had a <a href=""http://www.mediaite.com/tv/al-gore-blames-denvers-high-altitude-for-obamas-lackluster-debate-performance/"">completely different</a>, but no more logical, excuse for the President&rsquo;s loss last night. Gore blamed Denver&rsquo;s high altitude!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""I&rsquo;m going to say something controversial here,"" Gore began ""Obama arrived in Denver at 2 p.m. today &ndash; just a few hours before the debate started. Romney did his debate prep in Denver. When you go to 5,000 feet, and you only have a few hours to adjust &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;""
</p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here's a transcript of the exchange between co-anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos who anchored ABC News' post-debate coverage. This occurred even before Obama, Romney, and their families had left the debate stage: &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">DIANE SAWYER: Let me turn to you right now, George, nobody knows politics better than you. Here it is, bottom line, was there a clear winner tonight?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS:&nbsp; I think Governor Romney was definitely more crisp in his presentation. He was leaning into the debate when President Obama was a little bit more laid back. I think he was able to be aggressive without being offensive. So, even though there were -- I didn't see any knockout punches. No breakthrough moments or major mistakes. I think Governor Romney will get the boost that challengers usually get. The big question, did he do anything to dramatically change the trajectory of the race?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">SAWYER:&nbsp; [after some chatter about Twitter reactions to Romney's comments about Big Bird] I want to turn to Matthew Dowd, a key strategist for both sides of the aisle, at different points in his life. Is George right?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">MATTHEW DOWD:&nbsp; Well, I think this -- we all try to make comparisons to these races to previous presidential races and this race has been so eerily familiar to 2004 and tonight was another example of that. it is as if -- very much like Bush-Kerry. Bush came in with a lead, not huge, he came in to play for a draw and John Kerry came in to win. The exact same happened tonight. Mitt Romney came in to win this debate with passion and it looked as if the president came in, as long as I play for a draw, I keep a lead and go forward. If that's the case, I think a very close race just got a lot closer.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">SAWYER:&nbsp; Really? Played for a draw and succeeded?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">DOWD:&nbsp; No, the president played for a draw, but the guy that comes in and plays for a win usually gets the victory.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">STEPHANOPOLOUS:&nbsp; Does a tie go to the challenger?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Last night was easily the most decisive and crushing debate performance in the history of presidential debates. And yet, Stephanopoulos (a Democratic operative disguised as a news man) immediately attempted to spin an obvious and devastating loss for Obama into a &hellip;. draw. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But none of this is surprising. We all saw it coming a mile away. Last night, Stephanopoulos <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/ABC-s-Stephanopoulos-Attempts-to-Torpedo-Romney-s-Debate-Performance-Ahead-of-Time"">tee'd up his spin before the debate</a> and he also has an <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/Media-Watch-Stephanopolous-Debate-Winner"">almost perfect record</a> of immediately spinning debate victories for Democrats. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Think about how pathetic and partisan George Stephanopoulos really is. Even his Clinton-era colleague James Carville (who doesn&rsquo;t disguise himself as a journalist) admitted Romney ate Obama's lunch last night. But Stephanopoulos is so partisan and so corrupt and such a propagandist liar that even in the face of an undeniable reality he just couldn't bring himself to acknowledge it. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">If we were in anything resembling a just world, I would suggest to ABC News that, for the sake of their own credibility, they take a long hard look at how bad Stephanopoulos makes the entire franchise look. But that's not the world we live in. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">ABC News hired and elevated Stephanopoulos to do exactly what he did last night -- and like a good little flak, Georgie-boy once again sacrificed whatever's left of his reputation and credibility to the pagan god of The State. </p>

""This isn't the Mitt Romney the media's presented to me over the last six months.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Free of the corrupt media's filter; free of the spin, the lying fact-checkers, the gotchas, and the desperate effort to cover up any and all bad news that might hurt Obama -- by every standard, every measure, every opinion, and every opinion poll, what we witnessed last night at the first presidential debate of 2012 was a commanding, dominating blow-out performance by Governor Mitt Romney. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Last night the GOP contender showed up to kick butt and chew bubblegum, but unfortunately for &nbsp;Barack Obama, Romney was all out of bubblegum. The real loser, though, was a corrupt mainstream media that had just spent months desperately crafting a Mitt Romney that doesn't exist -- a Mitt Romney voters would not find acceptable as president.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We've all seen what's happened month after month after month after month: Obama's Media Palace Guards have assured us that Romney can do nothing right and Obama can do nothing wrong. This carefully crafted media game-plan (coordinated openly with the Obama campaign) was meant to strip Romney of the single quality voters demand in a president, and that's competence. &nbsp;If you're not competent, you&rsquo;re not an acceptable alternative, which means we're going to vote for ""the devil we know.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But last night all of this blew up in the media's face, and this morning the American people trust the media even less than they did the night before -- and for one very simple reason: they were lied to &hellip; again. Where was the bumbling, elitist, out of touch, awkward, wife-killing, gay-hating, corporate vulture who tortures dogs and stumbles through Europe like Chevy Chase in a ""Vacation"" sequel? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Well, he didn&rsquo;t show up last night because that's not who Mitt Romney is. <em>That</em> Mitt Romney is a media creation manufactured out of lies and desperation by those who spend 24 hours a day crafting trip wires, fabricating gaffes, and standing before the elephant of Barack Obama's failures and asking, ""What elephant?""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For all of moderator Jim Lehrer's flaws last night, the 78-year-old semi-retired PBS newsman did the only thing we conservatives ask of the media: he mostly stayed out of the way and offered up a fairly level playing field. There were no gotcha questions and no &nbsp;<em>What about your gaaaaaffes? &nbsp;</em>To his great credit (though he did try to rescue the president more than once), Lehrer kept the debate in an arena no liberal can win in --and that's on the issues. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Unlike his cretin colleagues, Lehrer was actually interested in the issues that matter. So he asked about taxes, job creation, education, the deficit, and an overall governing philosophy. In other words, he didn't stack the deck to distract from what a horrible philosophy big government liberalism really is. With a rare opportunity like this, if you&rsquo;re smart, prepared and all out of bubblegum, a conservative can win any debate. Obviously, Mitt Romney not only won last night, he delivered the kind of satisfying drubbing to Barack Obama we conservatives have been waiting four years to savor. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Yes, someone finally was given and took full advantage of the opportunity to point to that little emperor and say to the world, ""Look, he's naked!""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And now the lying, biased, corrupt, degenerate mainstream media has a problem on its hands. Because now the whole world knows that they were not only pointing to clothes that didn&rsquo;t exist but also attempting to destroy anyone who dared cry ""Naked!""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In ninety short but delicious and unforgettable minutes, Mitt Romney not only exposed President FailureTeleprompter as the churlish, entitled failure he truly is -- he also destroyed the caricature our thoroughly corrupted media institutions had built around him. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Romney's commanding victory was Reaganesque, and so is the result. In 1980, the media did everything in its power to &nbsp;scare voters away from Ronald Reagan by portraying him as a scary warmonger. But during his first and only debate with then-President Jimmy Carter, Reagan proved the media a liar. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This is exactly what Romney did last night, but unfortunately, he has two more debates ahead of him. This means that the media has two more kicks at the cat to rescue Obama, and Romney had better be prepared, because the push is already on to ensure he <strong>is</strong> asked, <em>What about your gaaaafffes? </em></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Even though Obama enjoyed four more minutes to speak than Romney, immediately after last night's debate, the left marched in unison to blame the moderator for not <em>controlling things</em> enough. And this makes perfect sense. Leftists know they can't win on a level playing field. But if the referee <em>takes control</em>, &nbsp;victory can be had!</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This means that for the two upcoming debates, Romney had better be prepared for questions about his dog, Bain, gaffes, wealth, taxes, high school bullying, perfect hair, the mole that wasn't there before, and his disastrously racist victory over Obama in the last debate.<em></em></p>

<p>
NBC fired a ""seasoned"" producer and two other employees after an internal investigation. It's being <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/nbc_sued_over_trayvon_tape_oVUCWcX6E8sU8FLDxAvHy"">reported</a> that ""Zimmerman&rsquo;s attorneys are ... naming news president Steve Capus and correspondent Ron Allen, who was the reporter on the scene for the broadcast on &ldquo;Today&rdquo; on March 27."" Indications are that the NBC has informed&nbsp;employees&nbsp;involved of the suit, instructing them to not comment to the media.</p>
<p>
The misleading edit made it appear as though the fact that Martin was black was somehow significant to Zimmerman, when in fact, he only mentioned it in response to a question from the 911 dispatcher.</p>
<p>

<p>The Empty Chair has better odds in Round Two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buster Douglas was better prepared for his fight against Evander Holyfield. Buster came to Vegas, took naps at the golf course, spend evenings at the buffets and decided not to train for his only Heavyweight Championship defense. It ended in a third-round knockout. Not sure if Barack Obama failed to train while spending 3 days here in Las Vegas before his debate, but if he did, he's in more trouble than anybody knows.</p>
<p>Certainly, most people who come to Vegas and spend three days here, expect to leave losers, but not this bad. I've seen a lot of Presidential Debates in my lifetime and never has there been a bigger blowout. At least some people who listened on radio thought Nixon beat JFK. You could've listened through a string and cup and the conclusion would've been the same. Romney by KO.</p>
<p>As the media searches, questions, wonders and freaks out (didya see MSNBC?) over why Mitt Romney smacked Barack Obama silly on Wednesday night, there are two simple answers---1) Romney has truth and facts and Obama is armed with failure, 2) the media lobbing non-stop softballs has left Obama totally unprepared. &nbsp;Obama's friends in the Activist Old Media bear much of the blame for the Denver Disaster 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it---at every turn Romney has been challenged, badgered, questioned, and queried over and over again and he has been forced to come up with answers. As it should be. Republicans know the game and it is not a level playing field. Obama has been coddled, protected, babied, and fed pablum by his media and when finally challenged, he fails miserably.</p>
<p>Yes, the media's game plan for Obama Victory 2012 has backfired miserably. It's just Round One in a Five Round debate season, but there were times when I almost felt sorry for Obama on that stage. Almost. Jim Lehrer finished second on this night mainly because he fed Obama better answers than Obama gave himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Romney still has Fast and Furious and Benghazi in his quiver. He fired Solyndra with laser-like accuracy.</p>
<p>The Veeps are up next. I'm making Paul Ryan a 14 and a half point favorite. Early money is coming big on Ryan. This line will be -17 by kickoff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>""He choked. He lost,"" Sullivan continued. ""He may even have lost the election tonight.""</p>
<p>In his final live blog update, Sullivan lamented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look: you know how much I love the guy, and you know how much of a high information viewer I am, and I can see the logic of some of Obama's meandering, weak, professorial arguments. But this was a disaster for the president for the key people he needs to reach, and his effete, wonkish lectures may have jolted a lot of independents into giving Romney a second look...</p>
<p>The person with authority on that stage was Romney - offered it by one of the lamest moderators ever, and seized with relish. This was Romney the salesman. And my gut tells me he sold a few voters on a change tonight. It's beyond depressing. But it's true.</p>
<p>There are two more debates left. I have experienced many times the feeling that Obama just isn't in it, that he's on the ropes and not fighting back, and then he pulls it out. He got a little better over time tonight. But he pulled every punch. Maybe the next two will undo some of the damage. But I have to say I think it was extensive.</p>

<div>Chuck Todd said on NBC Nightly News tonight that the Obama campaign does not want to make the mistake George W. Bush made against John Kerry in 2004 in their first debate. Kerry did well in that debate and got a 6-7-point bump after. Todd said that is why Obama has prepared considerably for this debate and is taking it seriously. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That is not what the mainstream media has been telling us this week, though. The mainstream media has been reporting that Obama could be too busy with national security issues to adequately prepare. These reports&nbsp;deliberately tried to lower expectations for him.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, it seems that Obama has been preparing more than his team or the mainstream media has been letting on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course, this should not come as a surprise to anyone. Of course a president whose re-election chances hang in the balance will fully prepare for this debate. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So it leaves one to ask: Is the mainstream media&nbsp;stupid enough to fall for the Obama campaign's spin or simply dishonest and&nbsp;knowingly spinning facts they know are not true?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Probably both. </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>CBS Evening News Sets Romney Up For Failure -- Tony Lee</strong></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Right off the bat, CBS Evening News both sets high expectations for Romney and makes it seem like Romney is a candidate on the ropes, even though a recent <em>National Journal</em> Poll had Romney and Obama tied, and Romney has been gaining in swing states like Virginia and Florida, in addition to leading polls of swing states by respected polling organizations. </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the lead-in, CBS showed two clips.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first is Obama saying that ""Gov. Romney has shown himself to be a very good debater.""</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The next clip is Scott Pelley asking Romney, ""Do you think the debates are make-or-break for you?""</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CBS wants the viewer to think Romney is a good debater and that he's on the ropes. CBS is trying to give Romney less room for error in the mainstream media's ""expectations game."" </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Corrupt Media's Spin Will Begin Tonight On Twitter </strong></p>
<p>Tonight will be the first ever presidential debate in the age of Twitter. This means the corrupt media will be using the social media device to signal and coordinate plans of attack Romney. Whatever narratives are set tonight will not be set on the stage or in the post-debate spin room. Tonight's narrative will be set by a member of the corrupt media tweeting something&nbsp;other members of the corrupt media feel they can latch on to in order to declare Obama&nbsp;a Sun God.</p>
<p>Our job in New Media is to be on Twitter fighting this, and doing what we can to get ahead of it. </p>

<p>The 2007 Times Picayune article began like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re desperate, out of options, have nowhere else to turn, Brandon Darby wants you to call him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Really.&nbsp; He handed me a business card with his new toll-free number on it and asked me to spread the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think using the director&rsquo;s number as a help line is kind of unusual,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Brandon is Operations Director for Common Ground Relief, a grassroots group that formed in the first days after Katrina and keeps evolving to meet the needs of the New Orleans area.</p>
<p>The volunteers are probably best known for gutting houses, but they&rsquo;re helping people rebuild their lives in many ways.</p>
<p>Brandon is a &ldquo;buck stops here&rdquo; kind of guy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why he wanted his number to be the helpline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are solutions to almost every problem if we know what the problem is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, that article is nowhere to be found online.&nbsp; Like so many others regarding Darby before and after it in the media world, the article seems to have fallen down the memory hole, to be disappeared forever.</p>
<p>A cursory search of LexisNexis rediscovers the article, however.&nbsp; The full piece is offered here for your own reading pleasure. </p>

<p>Instead, what appears in its place are a series of articles that seem to be an exercise in history revisionism &ndash; articles by the same author, posted by the same publication, and the name Brandon Darby has been eradicated from existence.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Regular readers at Breitbart News recognize Brandon Darby as a fellow Breitbart contributor. A former left-wing activist, Darby was once a familiar face on the grassroots scene in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA.&nbsp; In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Darby formed Common Ground Relief with three others.</p>
<p>But that all began to change in 2008.</p>
<p>Darby turned to the FBI when he recognized that a colleague of his at the time, Riad Hamad, was attempting to funnel money from Hamad&rsquo;s Palestinian nonprofit organization, The Palestine Children's Welfare Fund (PCWF), to aid enemies of Israel.&nbsp; Hamad had been suggesting a visit to the Middle East that included proposals of violence.&nbsp; Darby refused and was content to let the issue go, but when he realized that Hamad continued to try and convince others to join him instead, Darby knew that he had to inform law enforcement to stop that plan.</p>
<p>Soon after, Darby found himself working undercover as an informant with the FBI&rsquo;s Joint Terrorism Task Force, when activists from a fringe left group the FBI termed as the &ldquo;Austin Affinity Group&rdquo; - &ndash; which included David McKay and Bradley Neal Crowder - plotted to utilize explosive devices at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>The details of just how involved and dangerous the Austin Affinity Group&rsquo;s plans were can be seen in this 2009 press release issued by the <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/minneapolis/press-releases/2009/mp052109a.htm"">Minneapolis Division of the FBI</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following a FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation, McKay was arrested by the St. Paul Police Department during the execution of a search warrant on Sept. 3 at a residence on Dayton Avenue. Police found eight assembled Molotov cocktails in the basement. They consisted of bottles filled with gasoline with an attached wick made from tampons.</p>
<p>According to trial testimony, the FBI in Texas began investigating the group, labeled by law enforcement as the Austin Affinity Group, in February 2008. McKay and Crowder were members of the group.</p>
<p>McKay admitted that on Aug. 28, 2008, he, Crowder and other members of the Austin Affinity Group traveled from Austin, Texas, to Minnesota. The group brought a rental trailer with them that contained 35 riot shields, made from stolen traffic barrels. The intended use of the shields was to help demonstrators block streets near the Xcel Energy Center in order to prevent convention delegates from safely reaching the convention. St. Paul Police seized these shields on Aug. 31.</p>
<p>According to trial testimony, McKay and Crowder, angered by the loss of the shields, purchased supplies for constructing Molotov cocktails at a St. Paul Wal-Mart on Aug. 31, including a gas can, motor oil and tampons. They also purchased gasoline at a gas station. They then manufactured the eight Molotov cocktails at an apartment on Dayton Avenue where they were staying.</p>
<p>Law enforcement learned through an informant that McKay and Crowder had manufactured the Molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>During a conversation overheard by law enforcement through electronic surveillance on Sept. 2, McKay told an informant that he intended to throw the Molotov cocktails at police vehicles parked in a lot near the Dayton Avenue apartment. The parking lot was used as a checkpoint area for vehicles entering the security perimeter around the convention site. It was visibly patrolled by the U.S. Secret Service, various police agencies and the military.</p>
<p>During the execution of a search warrant by the St. Paul Police Department at the Dayton Avenue residence where McKay was staying when he was arrested, officers seized a variety of items, including gas masks, slingshots, helmets and knee pads. Under the kitchen sink, officers discovered a two-gallon gasoline container identical to the one purchased by McKay at the WalMart on Aug. 31. In the basement of the residence, officers found eight assembled Molotov cocktails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/106481018/090808-Mckay-Affidavit"">full affidavit</a> that was filed by FBI Special Agent Christopher Langert in the state of Minnesota for the case, McKay had expressed no concerns that a cop could potentially be inside one of the cars they planned to hit with Molotov cocktails, and remarked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth it if an officer gets burned or maimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Darby publicly revealed his role as an informant and his involvement in the arrests eventually became clear, there was a coordinated effort to push the narrative that the activists were victims of entrapment, at the hands of Darby.&nbsp; But in the same press release from the <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/minneapolis/press-releases/2009/mp052109a.htm"">Minneapolis Division of the FBI</a>, it was revealed by a judge that such charges were false.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today&rsquo;s sentence included a finding by Judge Davis that McKay obstructed justice at his January trial by falsely accusing a government informant, Brandon Darby, of inducing him to manufacture the Molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>Judge Davis told McKay that while it was acceptable for people to peacefully protest, McKay&rsquo;s activities took him down a different path, one of anarchy. &ldquo;I saw you on the videotape,&rdquo; Judge Davis added, referring to evidence shown of McKay during a recording of a violent protest. &ldquo;You were leading the charge. You and Crowder were coming up here (to Minnesota) to do anarchy against the system.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darby had ultimately decided to come forth and testify against one of the two bomb makers. Admittedly, this seemed an awkward place for Darby &ndash; not only had he been part of the activist left, but like many others in the New Orleans area, he hadn&rsquo;t always placed his trust entirely with law enforcement personnel. &nbsp;But as Darby&rsquo;s concerns about radicalism in the activist left grew, as did his relationship with the FBI, he began to realize that those around him for all these years did not reflect the principles or the political viewpoints he truly espoused.</p>
<p>Darby was named as the key witness in a related case on December 29th, 2008.&nbsp; The New York Times went into <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/us/05informant.html"">narrative changing mode</a> &ndash; rather than focusing on the alleged crimes of Darby&rsquo;s fellow activists and the physical evidence detailed in the FBI reports, the newspaper instead focused on the perceived betrayal by Darby in the eyes of leftist activist circles. &nbsp;Almost overnight, posters sprung up all across communities in which Darby lived, denouncing him. </p>
<p>In all the scorn of Darby from activists and media on the left, the narrative that eventually came to be was a false one.&nbsp; It neglected one of the single most important admissions made by defendant David McKay to the court in his second trial:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=45694662"">he lied about Brandon Darby</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""My belief was that Brad [Crowder] was going to say something that was not true to protect himself,"" he told [Judge] Davis. But he admitted that he'd done the same thing. ""I embellished -- I guess actually lied -- that Brandon Darby came up with the idea to make Molotov cocktails.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darby&rsquo;s FBI involvement was neither celebrated nor appreciated by activists and media on the left. Though thousands of activists had come through Darby&rsquo;s Common Ground organization in New Orleans, many of them bloggers, not one negative story about him or his character had surfaced in the multitude of media stories that existed about him or his organization <strong>prior</strong> to the public revelation of his FBI involvement.</p>
<p>But now, all of Darby&rsquo;s prior accomplishments were taken from him. </p>
<p>Lisa Fithian, the infamous Occupy organizer and paid labor union agitator, began claiming that Darby was only &ldquo;nominally involved&rdquo; in New Orleans and hadn&rsquo;t co-founded Common Ground Relief at all, a statement that even fellow organizer Malik Rahim &ndash; who himself was disappointed to learn of Darby&rsquo;s informant status - disputed in the same January 6, 2009 <a href=""http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/6/prominent_austin_activist_admits_he_infiltrated"">Democracy Now interview</a>. Fithian portrayed Darby as a sex-fiend who hated women, never acknowledging Darby&rsquo;s role in founding a women&rsquo;s shelter. Another Common Ground Relief co-founder, Scott Crow, denounced Darby and claimed he didn&rsquo;t start the organization, despite having publicly credited Darby as a co-founder previously.</p>
<p>The facts that were presented by Darby, and subsequently the FBI, jeopardized the image that the broader movement had been trying to portray for itself - that it was a movement of non-violence.&nbsp; In order to save face, they would have to change the narrative.&nbsp; Darby was recharacterized, reinvented by his fellow activists - not as someone who did the right thing in the face of a difficult situation, but as someone who preyed on helpless young activists on the left and actively &ldquo;infiltrated&rdquo; and &ldquo;entrapped&rdquo; them into breaking the law.</p>
<p>Unable to defend himself against this revisionism due to the upcoming trial, Darby&rsquo;s character was smeared and damaged in what appeared to be a concerted effort to discredit his testimony against the accused activists.</p>
<p><img alt="""" height=""425"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2012/10/03/BrandonDarby-poster1.jpg"" width=""355"" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brandon Darby was labeled a &ldquo;snitch&rdquo; and since 2008, his story has been revised and retold time and time again by many on the left.&nbsp; To this day, he endures countless attacks on his character, many of them citing the false representation of the facts in that trial.&nbsp; Despite whatever other history may have existed amongst Darby&rsquo;s circle of activists before this time, the facts are in the court documents &ndash; something that media rarely highlighted.</p>
<p>And so this began much of the revisionism that we see today in Darby&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; Not only have negative stories been plastered about him all across the internet, including a New York Times article that prompted Darby to sue the publication for defamation in March of 2011, but we now see another instance of a positive piece that accurately depicted Darby and his work with the Common Ground Relief and Women&rsquo;s Shelter has been scrubbed from the internet.</p>
<p>This turn of events initiated the life-changing transformation of Darby&rsquo;s conversion from political left to right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken with Brandon Darby about this time in his life, and about his political conversion.&nbsp; He maintains that not much about him as a person has changed &ndash; he&rsquo;s always believed in leveraging fellow members of the surrounding community to provide assistance to those in need &ndash; but the people with whom Darby surrounds himself has.&nbsp; While he once thought that the left stood for his ideals, his personal experience has taught him that he saw the right in a false portrayal.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s since found that other activists and organizations on the right have been a far more suitable fit for his ideology and his goals.&nbsp; When I asked Brandon how he reconciled this shift, he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life provided me with experiences many don't get to have. I was able to participate in basically being ""the government"" in Katrina's aftermath until actual governmental agencies returned. I was able to actually work with and see the character of many of the Left's heroes and leaders; I was able to taste the fruit of left-of-center methodologies. The result was an appreciation for our system of checks and balances, how it was institutionalized. I began to think it strange that others called for more of people relying on governmental aid. I began to feel the solutions were in less governmental control of lives and more of personal responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darby&rsquo;s story is unfortunately not all that uncommon.&nbsp; Others at times have also found themselves in his shoes.&nbsp; Too often, the facts don&rsquo;t fit the narrative, and invested parties &ndash; including media &ndash; will rewrite their own.&nbsp; I suppose some may see this post as doing the same.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s balance.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/zrpLJc9w1VE"" width=""1"" />"

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Once the Daily Caller story did hit, and it became clear that Tucker Carlson <strong>had</strong> found never-before-seen video of Obama in a way voters have never seen him, none of that mattered. The desperate narrative to protect Obama had already been set and, as though the rest of us were insane, the corrupt media doubled down in its efforts to tell those of us who had never seen this video that we had. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Of course, it's all lies &ndash;&nbsp;blatant lies meant to control the explosion of an explosive story, meant to justify why the very same media still obsessed over Romney's ""47 percent"" moment will now downplay and ignore as a nothingburger Obama caught on video spewing racialist division and the kind of wild conspiracy theories a sitting U.S. Senator had to know weren't true. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But New Media is The Media, and this video will get disseminated and voters will see it. And like Romney's ""47 percent"" moment, this new Obama video is a legitimate news story worth covering. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here are ten reasons why&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>1. The video released by the Daily Caller last night does include footage the media never broadcast or reported on.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Furthermore, we're supposed to believe it's just a coincidence that the footage the media ignored just happens to be the most controversial part, where Barack Obama (who at the time was running to be the Democratic nominee for president) goes off-script and tells a majority black audience that the federal government doesn't care about Hurricane Katrina victims because they're black. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Even Politico's mainstream media water-carrier Dylan Byers had <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/obamas-speech-how-they-covered-it-137319.html?hp=l1_b3"">to admit</a> this is the case:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">But the full footage of the speech included previously unreported remarks in which Sen. Obama suggested that the federal government helped victims of 9/11 and Hurricane Andrew (in Florida), but did not help the victims of Hurricane Katrina because it didn't care about them as much.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">By any measure, new video of a sitting president sewing seeds of racial division is not only news, but big news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">If this were Allen West giving the exact same speech, you better believe it would be everywhere. And he's only a congressman. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>2. Now we know the media and the Obama campaign ""selectively edited"" the video in 2007 in order to cover up Obama's divisive racial rhetoric.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's most certainly news.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>3. Past is prologue. Always.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obama's attacks on the suburbs and the ""us vs. them"" rhetoric that toxifies the entire speech helps make sense of his divisive presidency and campaign. Moreover, the speech that made Obama a national star was his 2004 address at the Democratic Convention where he was famously unifying and post-racial. That was his ""no red states, no blue states"" speech. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Now we know the 2004 speech was bull shit. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Obama grew up in Hawaii and Chicago, so where in the world does that hilariously fake southern accent come from?</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Like a lot of politicians, depending on the audience he's with, this president can be a huge phony. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">I'm a news and political junkie and never once have I heard him speak with this pronounced a southern accent. So&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news to me, and probably to a lot of people. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>5. In order to stoke racial division and resentment, Obama lied to his audience.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The then-U.S. Senator tells the audience that the federal government waived the Stafford Act for New York after 9/11 and for Florida after Hurricane Andrew, but not for New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/02/obama-speech-jeremiah-wright-new-orleans/2/"">was a lie</a>: </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">[T]he federal government did at times waive the Stafford Act during its reconstruction efforts. On May 25, 2007, just weeks before the speech, the Bush administration sent an additional $6.9 billion to Katrina-affected areas with no strings attached.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">As a sitting United States Senator, Obama must have been aware of this. And yet he spent 36 minutes at the pulpit telling a mostly black audience that the U.S. government doesn&rsquo;t like them because they&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Which leads me to&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>6. Obama is prone to believing and spreading dishonest and wildly false conspiracy theories.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">You know, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUzLpO1kxI"">like Kanye West</a>. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>7.</strong> <strong>At the 19:20 mark we learn that the Christian Obama doesn't know the Lord's Prayer.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Obama's ""us vs. them"" rhetoric and beliefs extends to his governance.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;At the 28:50 mark, Obama talks extensively about the importance of minority-owned businesses and supporting your own. He then proposes using the Small Business Administration specifically to aid minorities. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>9.</strong> <strong>At the 20:10 mark, Obama laments the social injustice that created 37 million Americans living in poverty and pledges to fight that injustice as president.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">After four years of Obamanomics, we now <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/us-poverty-census_n_1877197.html"">have 10 million more Americans living in poverty. </a></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>10.</strong> &nbsp;<strong>When Obama gave this speech, the Reverend Wright scandal had yet to break. </strong></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This means that the scant, incomplete, and ""selectively edited"" coverage the speech received at the time wouldn't have thought much of the full minute Obama spends gushing over his mentor and pastor in his opening remarks. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Knowing what we know now makes this, yes, news. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">----</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The corrupt media knows this newly released footage is news. They just don't want voters to see Obama for what he is: a phony, divisive, racial demagogue and grievance-monger ready to spread lies, conspiracy theories, and animosity in order to get what he wants.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Oh, I almost forgot&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><strong>11.</strong> <strong>We know it's news because the corrupt media is telling us there's nothing to see here, even as they kill themselves to blow it back on Romney&nbsp;and ensure as few people as possible see it.</strong>&nbsp; </p>

It is also leftist and predictable, but that would be three things.</p>
<p>So, here we go with a prediction born of the leftist transparency we find with the Activist Old Media.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime after November 7th the media will begin doing its job. Now...it still won't<em> fully</em> do it's job, but it will at least give it the ol' College Journalism School Try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two scandals should be rocking this White House right now. By themselves, each is worse than Watergate, and combined they would make Barack Obama the most scandalous president in history. Fast and Furious, the Benghazi terrorist attack; and lies and cover-ups with both.</p>
<p>There is an election to win right now for the media and its Dear Leader, so neither scandal will get the attention it deserves. We know that, we see that. Oh...they may touch on these stories and bite around the edges, but the junk yard dogs sit muzzled and chained while the Obama administration has its way with the merchandise (in this case, <em>we</em> would be the merchandise.) Never forget this is the same media that spent four years, <em>four years</em> attacking the George W. Bush White House over the supposed leaking of a non-covert CIA agent's name. A story the media got horribly wrong, but oh well, the Bushies had it comin'.</p>
<p>Whether Obama wins or loses this election, the media will suddenly learn of these two stories through osmosis (or they will click into Big Government and read them) and they will cover them as if they knew them all along. They will try to maintain a smidgen of credibility. Investigative reporters will be unleashed, books will be written, and Peabody's and Emmy's will be awarded en-mass.</p>
<p>If Obama loses November 6th, the media will have ignored its motto of ""speaking truth to power"" because Obama will be out of power. It does little good then. The time to do these stories is <em>now.</em> Right now. But clearly the media feel loose seats on an American Airlines jet where nobody was hurt is more important. Gotta protect our viewers from possibly bumping their heads---but 4 dead in Benghazi and 300  killed in Fast and Furious will have to wait (oh, plus the lies and cover-ups, remember with Watergate it was the lies and cover-ups that were worse.) There was no desire by the media to tell the voting public who Obama was in 2008, why would they suddenly do it in 2012? They will not, they have not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Obama wins November 6th (heaven help us---no really, heaven help us) the media will do what it has done to the second-terms of the most recent presidents in memory. The media will exert its power and make sure <em>that</em> president knows that<em> they</em> are in charge. &nbsp;Never forget, as much as they love Obama, they love themselves and their power more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second-term scandals, real or perceived are the reality. Nixon-Watergate, Reagan-Iran Contra, Clinton-Monica, Bush-Just being alive. Historians have argued that presidents get cocky in their second terms and that leads to their demise, and part of that is true, but the Obama scandals have been uncovered in his<em> first</em> term. I shutter to think what scandals might become us if he gets four more years. I haven't even mentioned the scandals of where the ""stimulus"" dollars were spent.</p>
<p>The Activist Old Media will do these stories and they will want credit for doing them. They will tell themselves how tough they were on Obama and they will point to the awards on their shelves as proof. Of course, we know the truth. When these stories needed to be done the junk yard dogs sat silent, by choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are still a few weeks left to cover these scandals when they matter most, but the media will not. They would've by now. The facts are out there <em>now</em> and it will matter little when they report them later. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have muzzled and chained themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amidst all the pre-spin build up to the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney, Lehrer is being overlooked as a key player in tonight's made-for-TV reality show. Make no mistake, the PBS journalist will be just as important to the proceedings as the height of the podiums and the color of the neckties. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the laughable expectations game put forth by the mainstream media that has somehow positioned Mitt Romney as the finest debater since Socrates and Barack Obama as a fledgling dolt barely capable of putting two sentences together, the fact is Obama has an enormous built-in advantage tonight. And that advantage will be sitting at a desk looking up at him the entire ninety minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lehrer told the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/us/politics/debate-moderators-are-subject-to-partisan-rancor.html?hp&amp;_r=0""><em>New York Times</em></a> he was ""outraged"" over criticism of his choice to moderate the first debate. The paper of record described him as ""seething"" over the suggestion that perhaps America could have been served better by a different choice this time around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>""I&rsquo;m susceptible to the same smears as anyone else,"" he told the paper of record. Yes Jim, you are. But to many Americans, those you might not always come in contact with during your commute to the PBS studios, focusing on your history of slanted and offensive questions during the presidential debates does not constitute a ""smear."" It is better described as critical observation used to hold a journalist accountable -- especially a journalist entrusted with such an important job as facilitating a forum of ideas between the two people vying to become the leader of the free world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So to that end, we present the Breitbart News analysis of Jim Lehrer's greatest hits. We call it: ""30 Years of  Presidential Debates Liberal Bias."" The clips we've found are not just confined to Lehrer's performance during the debates. You see, Mr. Lehrer has enjoyed the opportunity to speak before many college groups about his experiences as presidential moderator. We're sure the reader won't be shocked to discover that he has plenty of ridicule to dole out to the Republican candidates he encountered and tons of praise for the Democrats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please enjoy it and keep this in mind as you watch tonight's debate. The moderator is far from moderate. He's a progressive. And that's why he got the gig. &nbsp;</p>

"490","http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BigJournalism/~3/6_tcw5PgWdo/Big-Three-Nets-STILL-Ignoring-Univision-Fast-Furious-Blockbuster","","Big Three Networks Ignore Univision Fast & Furious Special","28","2","0","","2012-10-03 05:38:12","<p><img src=""http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/univision-f-and-f.jpg"" /></p><p>Spanish-language network Univision recently aired a shocking expos&eacute; of the Obama administration's gun running program -- called Fast &amp; Furious -- a policy that has ended up in the murder of hundreds of Mexican citizens. Despite this blockbuster report on Obama's lethal program and new accusations that 16 teenagers were killed by these weapons, neither ABC, CBS, nor NBC have yet said a word during their own news broadcasts about these developments.
</p>
<p>This news blackout is most surprising because the Univision report is so fraught with political repercussions both domestically and in relations between the United States and Mexico. Yet neither of the big three nets seems interested to report on this story.
</p>
<p>The most shocking incident of murder and destruction by narco-terrorists using Obama's guns was the attack on a birthday party attended by dozens of teenagers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On January 30, 2010, a commando of at least 20 hit men parked themselves outside a birthday party of high school and college students in Villas de Salvarcar, Ciudad Juarez. Near midnight, the assassins, later identified as hired guns for the Mexican cartel La Linea, broke into a one-story house and opened fire on a gathering of nearly 60 teenagers. Outside, lookouts gunned down a screaming neighbor and several students who had managed to escape. Fourteen young men and women were killed, and 12 more were wounded before the hit men finally fled.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>""Indirectly, the United States government played a role in the massacre by supplying some of the firearms used by the cartel murderers,"" Univision concludes.
</p>
<p>ABC's refusal to air any of Univision's report is doubly interesting. This is because ABC has actually <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/fast-furious-scandal-details-emerge-us-government-armed/story?id=17352694#.UGtEAfl27w6"">posted a report</a> on its own website about the Univision expos&eacute;. But despite its online coverage, ABC has ignored the Univision special on its own broadcast news programs.
</p>
<p>The Univision report is in Spanish, but a subtitled version hit the Web Tuesday.

</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning's <em>Good Morning America, </em>the former Clinton Administration staffer&nbsp;sternly warned that if Romney doesn't <em>exceed</em> expectations in the debates, he's finished.
</p>
<p>Why? Because Romney is under ""huge, huge"" pressure, <a href=""http://newsbusters.org/blogs/rich-noyes/2012/10/02/abcs-stephanopoulos-leads-post-debate-media-spin-democrats"">Stephanopoulos says</a>. And ""he's behind right now,"" so if he doesn't <em>over</em>perform, he'll be considered a failure.
</p>
<p>There is always pressure to perform well at debates, granted, but what George Stephanopoulos is trying to do here is set up  expectations of a great, sweeping Romney debate victory, one he couldn't possibly live up to. Stephy hopes to damage Romney's performance in the minds of ABC's viewers before he even steps one foot on the stage Wednesday.
</p>
<p>But this is par for the course for George Stephanopoulos. He's spent the last 12 years trying to pump up Democrat presidential debate performances. The Media Research Center put together a great montage of Stephy news clips from the past three presidential debates, all of which show him effusively praising the performance of the Democrat candidates.</p>

<p>Drudge previewed the tape's unveiling at 3:03 PM EST on Twitter Tuesday:</p>
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet tw-align-center"">
<p>Curious tape dropping tonight. NOT from MOTHERJONES. Will cause controversy,ignite accusations of racism -- in both directions!</p>
&mdash; MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) <a href=""https://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/253208624489459713"">October 2, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>Since then, the popular news website has leaked further details. The tape is in the possession of the Daily Caller, features the then-Senator giving a warm adulation to controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, and features divisive statements about inner cities vs. suburbs and the needs of the poor. The portion of the speech relating to Rev. Wright was <a href=""http://newsbusters.org/blogs/warner-todd-huston/2008/03/16/contrary-claims-obama-very-close-racist-preacher-wright"">previously covered</a> by Breitbart News's Warner Todd Huston in 2008.</p>
<p>A description from the Daily Caller reads, ""For nearly 40 minutes, using an accent he never adopts in public, Obama describes a racist, zero-sum society, in which the white majority profits by exploiting black America.""</p>
<p>The tape would not be aired or posted online until 9PM EST on Sean Hannity's Fox News program and on the Daily Caller website, but progressive journalists quickly began searching for the promised video.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed Politics posted several edited clips from the speech, apparently delivered at Hampton University in June of 2007. Others found a transcript of Obama's prepared statements. These sources did not contain all of the quotes teased by Drudge, which suggest the remarks were off the cuff.</p>
<p>Several progressive journalists have <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/02/Halperin-Seethes-at-Drudge-Over-Obama-Vid"">reacted</a> to the video's social media buzz <a href=""https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/253263366599106560"">angrily</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedBen/status/253261939663335425"">dismissively</a> before learning the contents of the full 40-minute speech.</p>
<p>UPDATE: In the <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/02/obama-speech-jeremiah-wright-new-orleans"">now-released video</a>, Obama goes off his script, which calls for racial and religious unity, and condemns the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina. Senator Obama proclaims that the government neglected to waive the Stafford Act, requiring hurricane victims to contribute 10% of each dollar spent by the federal government on cleanup efforts. In contrast, officials waived this provision of the Stafford Act for 9/11 and Hurricane Andrew. Obama insinuates that the waiver happened because, unlike predominantly black New Orleans, the government considers New Yorkers and Floridians ""part of the American family.""</p>
<p>Discussing the poor in America, Obama stated:&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expect them to have all the skills they need to work. They may need help with basic skills, how to shop, how to show up for work on time, how to wear the right clothes, how to act appropriately in an office. We have to help them get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daily Caller editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson <a href=""http://cms.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/02/Tucker-On-Obama-Speech-Not-Dog-Whistle-Dog-Siren"">tore into</a> the content of the speech in a ""Hannity"" interview after the controversial clips first aired on television. He described Obama's affected dialect as ""phony,"" challenged the truthfulness of Obama's Katrina aid account, and described the tenor of his speech as ""not a dog whistle"" but a ""dog siren.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carlson and co-author Vince Coglianese note that reporters were present for Obama's speech in 2007 but none of the racially charged quotes made it into print or video coverage of the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left-wing pundits and reporters alternatively attacked and downplayed the video. On the ""Hannity"" broadcast, commentator Juan Williams claimed the release of the tape was ""<a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/02/Wiliams-Accuses-Hannity-of-Playing-Race-Card-on-Obama-Speech-Video"">playing the race card</a>"" against Obama.</p>
<p>Politico depicted the video as old news:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>Wright, Obama said, is &ldquo;my pastor, the guy who puts up with me, counsels me, listens to my wife complain about me. He&rsquo;s a friend and a great leader. Not just in Chicago, but all across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0.9em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #ffffff;"">But as with other parts of the tape, that quote is not new &mdash; Obama&rsquo;s ad-libbed shout out made it to No. 3 on a POLITICO list of the top gaffes of the 2008 campaign.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0.9em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #ffffff;"">During the 2008 campaign, Obama made clear that he felt the federal government had let down the predominantly minority victims of Hurricane Katrina &ndash; so those sentiments also are not new. But Obama&rsquo;s words in the video come across as much more raw and more visceral than his usual carefully measured words about race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 0.9em; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #ffffff;"">On the second page of the Politico story, author Jennifer Epstein admits portions of the speech are ""newly unearthed.""</p>
<p>CNN's Howard Kurtz dismissed the Daily Caller's indictment of the media because, like today, no progressive reporters found the remarks <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/02/conservative-outlets-push-old-video-of-barack-obama-talking-about-the-poor.html"">newsworthy in 2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>An analysis of why some blacks are angry and frustrated is not the same as racial rabble-rousing, which explains why the speech drew little coverage at the time, when Obama had been a presidential candidate for nearly six months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 17th, journalists pursued presidential candidate Mitt Romney for comment on an incomplete video of remarks about the poor released by a left-wing magazine. Romney held a press conference the same evening as the tape segment's release. The press has not similarly pushed the Obama campaign for clarification of Obama's belief that the poor ""need help with basic skills.""</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/8ljwyVfYYoc"" width=""1"" />"

And more importantly, something that might derail all the wicked work he's done to drag a failed president over the reelection finish line. </p>
<p>Mark Halperin one of the leaders of what he calls ""The Gang of 500"" -- or those who control the media.&nbsp;He's the guy who yucks it up with Joe Scarborough every morning and who sits on political stories so he can later release them in books like ""Game Change"" that trash Republicans with legions of unnamed sources. </p>
<p>Halperin is as elite a mainstream media puppet master as there is; a narrative creator and driver that many minions in the media look to for the nod that okays this or that.&nbsp;And naturally, that nod almost always has to do with stories damaging to Republicans and/or helpful to Democrats. </p>
<p>But today Matt Drudge made Mark Halperin mad. Oh, so very, very mad. So mad, in fact, that Halperin is already raging on Twitter about how a story he hasn't seen is a ""freak show.""</p>
<p>You see, Matt Drudge stopped the world today without Mark Halperin's permission; Drudge launched a siren to tease out&nbsp;a video airing on Fox News tonight that&nbsp;might be damaging to Obama -- but&nbsp;if you're Mark Halperin that's the commission of an unpardonable sin on two levels:&nbsp;First off, only Mark Halperin's&nbsp;""Gang of 500"" is supposed to stop the world and control the narrative. Secondly, Halperin has already declared his precious Barack Obama the winner of this campaign -- so there will be no ""October Surprises."" </p>
<p>Now, you would think a self-described newsman and political junkie would be excited over this. After all, The Narrative about Romney losing the election and all the pre-game debate stuff is boring. Also, as a journalist, you would think new information about a sitting president would be exciting!</p>
<p>But the same Mark Halperin who helped drive&nbsp; Romney's ""47 percent video"" into the ground isn't happy at all about this video. In fact, he's furious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moderators help set the outcome for Democrats in three ways: by framing the questions against Republican candidates; by letting Democrats break the rules on time and rebuttals; and by favoring Democrats in post-debate analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best move in response? Mock the moderator.</p>
<p>
It worked for Sen. Scott Brown in 2010, when moderator David Gergen challenged him: &ldquo;Are you willing... to say, I&rsquo;m going to be the person, I&rsquo;m going to sit in Teddy Kennedy&rsquo;s seat and I&rsquo;m going to be the person that&rsquo;s gonna block [health reform] for another fifteen years?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brown&rsquo;s aggressive response won him the election:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, with all due respect, it&rsquo;s not the Kennedy seat, and it&rsquo;s not the Democrats&rsquo; seat. It&rsquo;s the people&rsquo;s seat.&rdquo;</p>
<center></center>
<p>
It also worked for Newt Gingrich in the Republican primaries, helping him surge to a win in South Carolina after putting CNN&rsquo;s John King in his place for asking about his ex-wife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to take some time to respond to that?&rdquo; King asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gingrich, &ldquo;but I will... I am appalled that you would begin a presidential debate with a topic like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The media hated it--and the audience loved it, giving Newt a standing ovation.</p>
<p>
As the Brown case illustrates, it&rsquo;s not just conservatives that love a good shot or two at the moderators--it&rsquo;s everybody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Democrats trust the mainstream media more than most, dislike of journalists and the media in general is widespread. It is the basis of Jon Stewart&rsquo;s entire comedy routine on ""The Daily Show""--which is where, we are told, Generation Y and the Obama-loving millenials get most of their primary information.</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a fine art to taking down the corrupt ref, and Sarah Palin played her hand a little too openly, giving disappointed liberals something to criticize after she beat Joe Biden soundly in the 2008 Vice Presidential debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telling PBS&rsquo; Gwen Ifill--who already had a book on Obama in the works, and went on to mock Palin&rsquo;s (superior) knowledge of the Boston Tea Party--that she &ldquo;may not answer the questions&rdquo; was Palin&rsquo;s only misstep.</p>
<p>
For the first presidential debate in Denver, the moderator will be Ifill&rsquo;s colleague at PBS, Jim Lehrer, who has a long history of helping Democrats in the debates and denied in 2008 what virtually everyone now admits--that the media was &ldquo;in the tank&rdquo; for Obama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is virtually guaranteed that Lehrer&rsquo;s questions will tend to put Romney firmly on the defensive, while setting Obama up for long monologues and filibuster-style evasions.&nbsp;But that also presents Romney with choice opportunities--and he must seize them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To attack the moderator is to speak directly to the American people, past the self-appointed liberal gatekeepers, and beyond the control of the comfortable incumbent who only has to beat the spread to satisfy the commentariat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, it&rsquo;s a tactic Obama can&rsquo;t use to the same effect: it would look petty, given that the media are in his corner already.</p>
<p>
Republicans--Romney included--have repeatedly made the mistake of allowing their political fates to be decided in debates run by the same people that devote the rest of their days and nights to destroying conservatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet there are some advantages to be found, even on an uneven playing field. If Romney can push back, at the right moment and with the necessary wit, he will defeat the moderator--and his other opponent, too.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/m9zSzbE4Ji8"" width=""1"" />"

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We all knew the media would protect Obama at all costs by distracting from the economy and attacking Romney over his wealth. That stuff wasn't hard to predict. It was the Obama game-plan, which meant it would be the media's as well. But the fun part of the discussion was in <em>imagining the possibilities.&nbsp; </em>How low would they go? How desperate would they act? How shameless? How brazen? How stupid? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We batted around every possible idea including the absurd, safe in the knowledge that when you&rsquo;re talking about the most corrupt institution allowed to operate legally in America, absurdities really aren't. But never in a million years would any of us have expected Politico to do what it did today. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The Middle East is burning; the White House is engaged in a cover up; the FBI cannot gain access to the scene of an ambassador's assassination at the hands of al-Qaeda; we learned today that security in Benghazi was not only lax but that requests for increased security were ignored; our GDP was just downgraded to 1.3%; orders for durable goods collapsed 12%; and poverty is on the march. </p>

But does the hyper focus of this fact, highlighted by a new video released from the Democratic National Committee shed too much light on the tactics of the government media to derail Mitt Romney&rsquo;s campaign?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DNC&rsquo;s choice to isolate sound bytes and news clips emphasizing the importance of Mitt Romney&rsquo;s performance this week as a make or break moment for his campaign sets the stage for a well crafted media narrative that we can all expect to see upon the slightest mistake or weakness that they can pin on Mitt Romney and use it as a tool to blow up in epic proportions against him.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking back at <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6043394#.UGnLc7SpW4R"">George Stephanopoulos&rsquo; commentary</a> after the final 2008 debate between candidates Obama and McCain provides insight towards what we can expect to see from the government media this time around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Obama did not get ruffled. He handled McCain's attacks extremely well. He was cool, he remained calm, and he did a good job of explained [sic] his positions&hellip;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">In terms of style, Obama won the battle of the televised split screens. McCain had several reaction shots during the debate where he rolled his eyes, seemed exasperated with Obama, and on the edge of anger.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">On the other hand, Obama remained cool under pressure, smiling through the attacks. That's the demeanor Obama's had throughout the three debates that has served him well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Ultimately, McCain didn't do enough to stop people from voting for Obama. Over the course of three debate [sic] the Obama campaign met their goal of reassuring the American people that he's ready to serve as president.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stephanopoulos&nbsp;continued by emphasizing the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; victory for Obama in that and both prior debates was &ldquo;staying cool under pressure,&rdquo; not for his ability to present winning solutions to the American people about problems facing our country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The DNC&rsquo;s new video also gives rise to the question: If the government media are not working with a narrative to reelect President, wouldn't it be not worth highlighting that this is most likely the biggest moment in his political career as well? After a tremendous victory in 2008, his first four years in office have proved that he was all talk. George Stephanopoulos was right, President Obama won because &ldquo;he was cool,&rdquo; not because of his ideas, and this debate would be just as much a make or break moment in the President&rsquo;s political career if they only treated it as such.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/b45xndYR5uY"" width=""1"" />"

<br />
One of the most reliable pro-Democratic pundits is none other than George Stephanpoulos &mdash; not especially surprising, given his track record as a loyal operative for Bill Clinton&rsquo;s 1992 presidential campaign, but hardly the objective, <strong><a href=""http://www.mrc.org/node/32823#4"">unbiased voice touted by ABC News</a></strong>.

</blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">Basically, what's happening here is that&nbsp;recently-released juiced polls with wild skews in favor of Democrat turnout still show the race closing. But since The Narrative to disqualify Mitt Romney must remain: <em>Romney can do nothing right and Obama can do nothing wrong --</em> a Romney comeback narrative is absolutely out of the question.&nbsp;Therefore, the media needs something to distract attention from these inconvenient polls. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">So, yesterday, the <em>Washington Post</em> cooked up a phony swing state poll so the media could talk about how Romney's losing by double digits in the swing states instead of how he's closing the race nationally.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">Today, it's Quinnipiac's turn to give the media a narrative to push that distracts from the race closing, and that's with yet another -- as Flynn points out -- ""meaningless statistics within their poll to boost"" Obama -- this time <a href=""http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1801"">the gender gap</a>:</p>

And this is a purely political and partisan choice the media's making &hellip; and a dangerous one. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">As we've seen with Mitt Romney, when properly motivated, the media can exact a heavy price from a politician over a sin found unpardonable. We saw this with Romney's taxes, Clint Eastwood's chair, Romney's statement the day after the Libya attack, the ""47 percent video"" and even swing state polls that show Romney behind. What the media's done with each of these stories is come together as one to use them as bludgeons to beat Romney senseless. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This, however, is not happening over a story the media should be outraged over -- &nbsp;the Libya cover up. Yes, the media's dutifully reporting on the story, and as you'll see below with CNN's Erin Burnett, even using the term ""cover up."" But as of now, there's been no bruising narrative, no call for the White House to come clean, and no demand for Obama to call a press conference and answer questions. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">--</p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">---</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">What the White House hit us with wasn't just spin either. In that clip, CNN's own foreign affairs correspondent reports that her sources told her within 24 hours that Benghazi was a terror attack. So she knows what the White House knew and therefore knew that the narrative spun out of the White House for eight days was a bald-faced lie. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Moreover, CNN isn't the only outlet with knowledge that the White House knew within 24 hours that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Numerous outlets -- not just Fox News -- reported within 24 hours that terrorists were behind the attack. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And yet, this very same media apparently had no problem being lied to for a week and still has no problem with it. Worse, even as the media reports on the Libya cover up, they obviously have no intention to hold anyone accountable for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And these were <strong>lies</strong> coming from the White House; not spin -- lies. Five days after the attack, when U.N.

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">CARNEY: All I can tell you is that based on the information that we had then and have now we do not yet have indication that it was pre-planned or pre-meditated.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt; text-align: center;"">---</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">These are not examples of spin or half-truths or even little white lies; these are outright lies -- concrete examples of the two high-placed administration officials speaking on behalf of a White House that knew what we were being told was not true. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Three, five, and eight days later, the White House was declaratively stating there was <strong>no</strong> intelligence stating that what happened in Benghazi was anything other than a spontaneous protest gone bad. Now we know the White House most certainly had intelligence stating Benghazi was terrorism. In fact, it now looks as though that was <strong>the only</strong> intelligence the White House had. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For just a moment, let's forget politics; let's forget about the election and let's forget Republican vs. Democrat. Instead, let's talk about what's healthy for our democracy. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">During the Bush administration, the media was most certainly biased and most certainly over-hyped any little thing they felt might hurt Bush -- no question about it. But during the Bush-era, I was at least able to relax, safe in the knowledge that the White House was being closely watched and scrutinized. There was a very real and healthy benefit found in the media's zeal to bring Bush down. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But the message the media is sending now is just the opposite: The media's telling powerful Democrats, including a sitting president, that when politics are on the line, you can pretty much do whatever you please. Lie to us, betray us, and then cover it all up -- no problem, because we want to get you over the finish line. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This isn't media bias; it's something much more sinister. It's being accessories after-the-fact &ndash;&nbsp;willing co-conspirators in a cover up. And the message it sends is what's most troubling, because if the powerful in either party can ever count on the fact -- that for whatever reason -- the watchdogs are willing to look away, there's no telling where it might lead. &nbsp;</p>

That man is TRN's Jerry Doyle.
</p>
<p>Noting that the network ""owns no stations"" and that its stable of hosts have to ""earn their keep "" by garnering syndicated affiliates, TRN promises radio stations that Doyle will be ""eminently saleable.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today begins the first in a series of changes to bring talk radio firmly into the 21st century. For too long, we&rsquo;ve had to choose between ratings and salability, but no longer. Today the 6th largest syndicated talk show in America replaces what was the 3rd largest show, and in so doing, stations will get more light and less heat, a show that they can sell locally with pride, but also a show that will respect its stations, advertisers and audiences with a brilliance that sets great shows apart from good ones.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doyle will debut on nearly 300 stations, a bit fewer than Savage as some stations have already made their own changes since Savage left the airwaves last month.
</p>
<p>Doyle, a former actor who for five seasons starting in 1994 had a recurring role on the hit science fiction TV series&nbsp;<em>Babylon 5</em>, broadcasts from Las Vegas, Nevada and has been a talk show host since 2000 after a losing bid for Congress in California.
</p>
<p>Savage, whose real name is Michael Weiner, <a href=""http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_21653093/michael-savage-leaves-radio-show-after-legal-win"">walked off his show</a> on September 28 after winning a court battle over a contract dispute with TRN. His lawyer told the media that Savage conducted a two-year battle to get out of a 10-year-old contract with the network. Savage complained that his contract precluded him from entering into talks with competing employers and essentially indentured him to TRN for life. After winning the case, Savage left TRN and his former show behind. He reports that he's in already in talks with networks to pick up a new program he plans to launch.
</p>
<p>Savage's show was heard on nearly 400 stations nationwide and according to Talkers Magazine, a talk radio trade publication, had an audience of <a href=""http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/"">8.75 million listeners</a>. In the 2012 <em><a href=""http://www.talkers.com/heavy-hundred/"">Talkers Heavy Hundred</a></em> ratings he was the third most popular talk show host. On that same list, Savage's replacement, <a href=""http://www.talkers.com/heavy-hundred/second/"">Jerry Doyle, appears in the 16th slot</a>.

<p>Nate Silver, gatekeeper of polls for the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>, called the attempt to debate polling data an episode of &ldquo;attacking the messenger.&rdquo; A headline under a photo of two Obama yard signs states: &ldquo;The 2008 race was a good one for polls: they got Barack Obama&rsquo;s margin of victory exactly right.&rdquo; A big self-congratulatory pat on the back for the mainstream media! </p>
<p>Silver then wastes his time by doing a history of all of final polls before elections and how they closely mirror the end result. Of course, we aren&rsquo;t debating the final polls. It's obvious pollsters will attempt to get the number right when their credibility is on the line. We are debating polls that happen <em>before </em>the final poll. Right now, these polls drive narratives like &ldquo;Romney is losing!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wow, women sure love Obama!&rdquo; and fill newspaper headlines for weeks. So a history lesson on the polls no one is complaining about misses the point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If Silver had decided to look at what polls from <em>NYT</em> and CBS were saying before their final poll in 2008, he would see that they had Obama winning by 14 early in October. That number would then drop to 13 in mid-October, and then 11 by the end of the month. The final CBS poll would settle in at 9 points, two points higher than Obama&rsquo;s final margin of victory. So yes, the &ldquo;final&rdquo; poll was within 2 points of getting the vote right. But the one taken less than 4 weeks earlier had estimated his lead by more than double what actually happened. I'm guessing Nate Silver would have a great explanation about the McCain surge no one else experienced. </p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times </em>(in conjunction with the CBS News and Quinnipiac University) have easily provided the <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/09/26/Media-Malpractice-NYT-Poll-Pushes-Absurd-Democratic-Turnout-Model"">worst polling samples</a> of the cycle, showing Democratic turnout at unprecedented levels in states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>But he is not alone. Chris Cillizza over at the<em>&nbsp;Washington Post</em> asks and answers: &ldquo;Does the &lsquo;skewed polls&rsquo; crowd have a point? Not really.&rdquo; Between two posts, he goes into a lengthy discussion as to why large over-sampling of Democrats is perfectly fine. Mostly, he says it is acceptable because according to Pew Research there are simply more Democrats in the country, and there always have been. That point is not in disagreement, but it is also well known that a large portion of self-described Democrats simply never vote. Typically, that's why some might look at exit poll data from prior years to see who actually turns out. </p>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>Cillizza argues that exit polling data is pointless. Yes, actual data from prior elections should not be used when analyzing polls. He says that &ldquo;perhaps most importantly, remember that the exit poll captures the composition of the last electorate &mdash; not the composition of the next electorate.&rdquo; He uses this excuse to avoid having to debate the main argument of poll critics: that the polls &ndash; chiefly those by <em>WaPo</em> and <em>NYT</em> &ndash; have far greater Democrats turning out than have ever turned out before. But hey, if Pew says so...</p>
<p>Cillizza declared Pew Research the &ldquo;gold-standard in non-partisan polling&rdquo; and said that the <em>WaPo</em> samples are correct because Pew's non-voting adult samples back up the argument. How good is Pew? In their final poll in 2008, Pew Research just about nailed the 2008 result when they predicted a 6 point win for Obama. But what&rsquo;s even more astonishing is that just a week before the election, on October 26th, the Pew poll had Obama up on McCain by an amazing 15 points. So in one week, McCain went from trailing Obama by 15 points to just 6 by election day. That was one heck of a surge for McCain at a time he was getting hammered and it was clearly over. But hey, Pew &ldquo;nailed it."" Or, perhaps, the last poll got a little extra tweaking so they wouldn't be embarrassed. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Almost all of the polls in 2008 showed Obama with a healthy lead for the final 6 weeks of the campaign, but the internal polling data made sense. This is why nobody was complaining about polls then. Against McCain, polls had Obama winning independents nationally and in just about every state by a healthy margin. Enthusiasm was sky-high among Democrats and below break-even with Republican voters. Obama was popular, and his favorability was in the 60-70% range by election day. First-time voter excitement was at levels never before seen. Every data point was pointing to an easy Obama win over McCain.</p>
<p>But the data is different this year. Polls show Romney has been <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/09/27/Romney-Winning-Swing-State-Independents-Media-Ignores"">winning independents</a> in key states. <em>USA Today</em>/Gallup <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/09/29/poll-obama-romney-gallup/1601125/"">showed</a> a complete reversal in enthusiasm from 2008, and Republicans now have a 16-point edge. And while Romney might not have Obama&rsquo;s 2008 favorability numbers, neither does Obama. Even there, Obama has dipped to break-even and not much better than Romney's, whose favorability numbers have been steadily climbing. And when it comes to job approval and handling of the economy, Obama is hanging in the 40s. Unlike 2008, the polling data just doesn't mesh with media's published declarations of Obama dominance. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is a good shot that we will see a &ldquo;Romney surge&rdquo; from these pollsters as November 6 approaches. It&rsquo;s also a good bet that most of the pollsters will get the winner right -- even if it is Romney -- on their final poll. But it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that many of their current polls are loaded with scenarios that are almost impossible in the present political climate. But at least they know we are watching now.</p>

<p>That's right, Gov. Romney is wasting his time campaigning and the citizens who support him are wasting their time too. In fact, conservatives and moderates, Republicans and Democrats, and the mass of independents who've planned to vote for Romney might as well just stay at home, because ""Obama wins.""</p>
<p>Congressman Paul Ryan need not continue pointing out the dismal state of Obama's foreign policy and Rush Limbaugh need no longer say Obama's economic policies are damaging this country. It's all for naught, because ""Obama wins.""</p>
<p>On what basis does the AP say this? On <a href=""http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2012/10/01/20121001obama-romney-election-standing.html"">the basis</a> of ""polls which show the president with a steady lead over Romney,"" of course. The problem is that some such polls, like the Washington Post-ABC poll, only surveyed <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/the-polls-show-a-race-that-is-still-up-for-grabs/2012/10/01/57b1d8a2-0be1-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html"">160 people</a>, and even then were only able to show an 11-point lead for Obama in a poll that has an 8-point margin of error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, his lead could be 3 points, and depending on how the poll is weighted internally, it could be nothing. And given the press's unrealistic partisan weighting of respondents, it's questionable whether he leads at all.</p>
<p>Just in case Romney supporters are smart enough to ignore the polls and show up to vote en masse on election day, the AP has covered its tracks by saying its ""analysis isn't meant to be predictive.""</p>

A v</span>ideo of Caddell&rsquo;s remarks were posted this weekend and has since gone viral.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""The press&rsquo;s job is to stand in the ramparts and protect the liberty and freedom of all of us from a government and from organized governmental power,"" Caddell proclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The critical passage of the speech reads:</span></p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When they desert those ramparts and decide that they will now become active participants, that their job is not simply to tell you who you may vote for, and who you may not, but, worse&mdash;and this is the danger of the last two weeks&mdash;what truth that you may know, as an American, and what truth you are not allowed to know, they have, then, made themselves a fundamental threat to the democracy, and, in my opinion, made themselves the enemy of the American people.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh praised Caddell&rsquo;s elocution on Monday.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;Caddell&rsquo;s right!,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;You can't bring yourselves to report the truth about this until the story is over, when it no longer matters.&nbsp; But for the five or six days that matter right after the story, you carry the regime's water.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell said Libya should have &ldquo;should have been the equivalent, for Barack Obama, of George Bush&rsquo;s &lsquo;flying over Katrina&rsquo; moment. But nothing was said at all, and nothing will be said.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">He expounded further:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p class=""p2"">If a President of either party&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care whether it was Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or George Bush or Ronald Reagan or George H. W. Bush&mdash;had a terrorist incident, and got on an airplane after saying something, and flown off to a fundraiser in Las Vegas, they would have been crucified!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell said the mainstream media &ldquo;crossed some lines&rdquo; in their coverage of Libya, and it was a &ldquo;frightening&rdquo; thing to him.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Caddell also accused the mainstream media of using polls they know are inaccurate as weapons against Republicans. He referenced polls whose samples predict Democrats will have a greater turnout in 2012 than in 2008 even as journalists write story after story about how nearly every part of the Obama coalition is less enthusiastic about him than they were in 2008.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">&ldquo;When I have polls that have the preference of Democrats over Republicans higher than it was in 2008, which was a peak Democratic year, I know I am dealing with a poll that shouldn&rsquo;t be reported,&rdquo; Caddell said. &ldquo;And yet they are being done, and they are being done with that knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">In an optimistic turn, Caddell declared the rise of new media made it easier to fight back against the mainstream media, and the old argument of &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t get in a pissing match with someone who buys ink by the barrel&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply in the new media era.<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">&ldquo;There are too many outlets, too many ways to do it, and the country doesn&rsquo;t have the confidence in the press that they once had,&rdquo; Caddell said, referencing a recent Gallup poll that found 60% of Americans distrust the mainstream media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell emphasized that mainstream journalists have thin skins, and they &ldquo;wilt&rdquo; when challenged. That is why, he explained, &ldquo;they need to be called out&rdquo; and &ldquo;their organizations need to be called out.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;The fact is, if I were out there, if I were doing one of these campaigns, I wouldn&rsquo;t let one of these guys by with anything,&rdquo; Caddell said. &ldquo;They have now made the decision they will control the political process. &nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">""They are serving&mdash;with the hundreds of millions of dollars that the networks and these newspapers are, in effect, contributing&mdash;in-kind contributions to candidates in the Democratic Party. That&rsquo;s the legal issue that I would have been exploring. I mean, I would begin to put the heat on.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">However, said, members of the Republican establishment do not say anything because &ldquo;too many reporters, too many political people in the Republican party in this town want to maintain their relationships with the press.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;The corruption in this town is so great. Everybody in Washington seems to almost be on the take&mdash;with the exception of everybody in this room, and the assistants here. Everybody&rsquo;s on the take here, and everybody&rsquo;s cutting up their stock,&rdquo; Caddell lamented. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, what used to be one of the best and most important things for the press, which was the investigative journalism of corruption and money, the stealing of the taxpayers, the looting of the Treasury, isn&rsquo;t an issue, and why no one speaks of it in this town.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re at the most dangerous time in our political history in terms of the balance of power in the role that the media plays in whether or not we maintain a free democracy or not,&rdquo; Caddell said.<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell listed off some examples of mainstream media malpractice during his speech. He wondered how the press could not ask how Valerie Jarrett could have a Secret Service detail and better security than Ambassador Chris Stevens. He wondered how Sunday talk show hosts would not ask David Plouffe, Obama&rsquo;s former campaign manager, about the $100,000 in speaking fees he received from an Iranian front group in Nigeria. He asked why the press would not look into Peter Schweizer&rsquo;s Government Accountability Institute study that documented the corruption behind many of Obama&rsquo;s green energy boondoggles.&nbsp;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">&ldquo;Of course Republicans don&rsquo;t raise it because in Washington, they simply want to do it when they get back in power,&rdquo; Caddell said. &ldquo;And, of course, the press doesn&rsquo;t because they basically have taken themselves out of doing their job.&rdquo;<span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p2"">Caddell went on Fox News on Monday and defended his remarks. He asserted the mainstream media helps Obama through omissions as well, by not reporting on stories about how the Obama administration is trying to suppress military absentee votes and bully defense contractors into not sending layoff notices that are required by law or laying off employees. Caddell said these omissions amounted to ""corruption of the first order.""&nbsp;</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/255bQkL-kKw"" width=""1"" />"

<p>But the corrupt media will report&nbsp;as gospel poll numbers based on a partisan advantage no one believes reflects what will happen on election day. But those of us who question poll numbers based on a turnout advantage no one thinks will occur are the crazy ones. The sane ones&nbsp;question NOTHING. </p>

"508","http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BigJournalism/~3/gsU1prk8Cpg/Media-Watch-WaPo-Bogus-Poll","","Media Watch: WaPo Swing State Poll Is Utter Garbage","28","2","0","","2012-10-01 19:58:00","<p>All day long the media has used a juiced <em>Washington Post</em> swing-state poll showing Romney down 52 - 41 as a bludgeon to further an unrelenting narrative that the race is over and Romney supporters are nothing more than fools wasting their time if they come out to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, even though the poll made no sense when you looked at the same poll showing Obama only up by two nationally, 49&nbsp;- 47.</p>
<p>But when it comes to The Narrative, though, corrupt media types like the <em>Washington Post </em>and Chuck Todd and their ilk, never once pause to wonder if something might be off about a poll like this -- even though it's obvious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But scrutiny and curiosity are not part of the&nbsp;media's job anymore. Today it's all about The Narrative and if The Narrative says Romney's losing, you must be a slave to The Narrative and never question that which contradict The Narrative -- even a poll as ludicrous and nonsensical as this one. </p>
<p>Thanks to some actual journalism, we have now learned that this ridiculous swing state poll reported as gospel all day is in fact <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/the-polls-show-a-race-that-is-still-up-for-grabs/2012/10/01/57b1d8a2-0be1-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html"">total and complete garbage</a>:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>As I learned from Post pollster Jon Cohen, that finding is based on the responses of a total of 160 people, and it has a margin of error of 8 percentage points. So yes, there <i>may</i> be a difference between swing-state and national numbers, but the gap might be very small or it might be big.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it's too late, isn't it? The damage has already been done. The message to start the week has already gone out. </p>
<p>Rather than focus on a number of national polls that show the race tightening, the corrupt media instead ran with this one to&nbsp;push the Romney-losing narrative. </p>
<p>The most revealing thing is that everyone knew this poll was junk; including the Chuck Todds of the world. But that doesn't matter -- what they know and what makes logical sense, doesn't matter. </p>
<p>What matters is that the poll fit The Narrative and could be weaponized against Romney. </p>

It's also owned by<em>The Washington Post</em>. </p>
<p>Saturday, The Root published an entire article devoted to this headline: <a href=""http://www.theroot.com/blogs/racism-election-2012/will-romney-reach-out-racists-debates""><em>Will Romney Reach out to Racists in Debates?</em></a></p>
<p>The subtext of the article is&nbsp;even more noxious; that if Romney does win it will be due to racism:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>Now the Romney campaign finds itself at a crossroads. With just over a month to go before the election, the question becomes: Will he be willing to do what McCain wasn't, in order to win at any cost? Will he give in to the temptation and begin lacing his ads and language with messages to appeal to those who miss the days of the Southern strategy -- and the days of a white Republican president? </p>
<p>We've already seen him begin flirting with the racially inflammatory line by making a joke about his birth certificate that many saw as a reference to the manufactured controversy surrounding the president's birth. Romney's language in the debates will confirm whether or not he is willing to cross that line in the quest for victory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the fact that the <em>Washington Post</em> owns a publication that would engage in that kind of Racial McCarthyism isn't troubling enough, a source tells me that on Saturday, The Root story appeared prominently on <em>Washington Post's</em> home page under top headlines -- with an even worse headline:</p>

Her effort can only be described as revolting, as she attempted to apply lace to the disgusting dress of evangelic-infanticide while also managing to reinforce other dominant and false left-of-center narratives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goldberg interviews a doctor who heads a Dutch ""effort to bring safe abortions"" to nations where the practice is outlawed. The pro-abortion Dutch group behind the effort is named ""Women on Waves,"" and they set out via ship to provide what they call the ""fundamental human right of autonomy and sexual freedom.""
The group's founder, Dutch gynecologist Rebecca Gomberts, says her effort was inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Though Goldberg does make brief mention of the fact the Dutch government has previously declared Gomberts' efforts as ""lacking of appropriate medical training,"" her piece glances over this shortcoming by surrounding it with deifying statements about the article's subject.
Goldberg adds insult to injury by throwing left-of-center reframing efforts into the mix. For instance, her assertion that ""Islamic law isn't as militantly anti-abortion as Catholic doctrine"" lends to the mainstream media's efforts to frame the over-abundance of militancy of many Islamists as somehow comparable to the isolated incidents of Christians engaging in militant behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After making the assertion that Catholic doctrine is more militant than Islamic doctrine, Goldberg then mentions the death threats and dangers Islamists pose to Women on Waves -- seemingly hoping Daily Beast readers don't realize such details reveal the inaccuracy of her assertion.

She doesn&rsquo;t report that Mr. Ryan loaned his budget committee staff director to Mr. Hensarling on the super committee.

<p>In a dishonest and misleading attempt to defend&nbsp;yet another one of his&nbsp;unrelenting, arrogant, smug, anti-Romney attacks -- but one that blew up in his face over the weekend&nbsp;-- Scarborough claimed this morning that&nbsp;MSNBC did not doctor audio to make it&nbsp;sound as though a crowd chanting ""Romney"" was chanting ""Ryan."" And what Scarborough committed in doing so was a&nbsp;lie of omission.</p>
<p>What Scarborough&nbsp;was referencing was a clip&nbsp;MSNBC broadcast all of last week that&nbsp;made it look as though&nbsp;an arrogant, hapless, and insecure Mitt Romney attempted to change a ""Ryan"" chant at a campaign rally&nbsp;into a chant that that included his name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the media loves to use willing Republicans to undermine Romney, Scarborough's reaction to the clip got the most media attention. You&nbsp;can watch&nbsp;it <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/09/28/MSNBC-Caught-Doctoring-Clip-From-Romney-Ryan-Rally"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Note: To emphasize&nbsp;the crowd was chanting ""Ryan,"" MSNBC added a subtitle that read: ""Crowd: Ryan!""</p>
<p>A day or two after the clip aired and MSNBC had re-broadcast it endlessly, it was discovered that the crowd was not chanting ""Ryan;"" that in fact the crowd was chanting ""Romney.""&nbsp;Numerous on-the-scene reports filed in real-time reported the crowd chanting ""Romney,"" including the <em>New York Times</em>. </p>
<p>This means two things...</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>1. MSNBC's subtitle was incorrect. </p>
<p>2. The impression that an arrogant, insecure Romney wanted his name added to the crowd's chant is exactly wrong. The truth is that a gracious Romney wanted Ryan's name added to the chant. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you know the facts, watch Scarborough's misleading defense of his and his network's behavior last week:&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<center></center>
<p>Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;Scarborough doesn't address the fact that MSNBC incorrectly added the subtitle,&nbsp;""Crowd: Ryan!""</p>
<p>Moreover, the video Scarborough played of the Romney rally did not include MSNBC's&nbsp;incorrect subtitle from last week, because Scarborough didn't replay the MSNBC clip. Obviously, Scarborough didn't want to address the subtitle, because that would undermine his whole defense, which is based on the fact that MSNBC altered nothing. </p>
<p>Except MSNBC did alter something; they altered the perception of the entire event with an incorrect subtitle. </p>
<p>Apparently Sell-Out Joe's selling out to the corrupt media is so complete he not only reaffirms every anti-Romney lie his NBC Masters manufacture; he's also a part of the media's&nbsp;indefensible memory-holing of inconvenient facts. </p>

In the Norquistian world that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and the 21st Century Republican Party want to create, soup lines like the one where Big Bird stands in tonight's Night Owls banner would be the answer to the social needs of the jobless and the working poor not making enough money to put food on the table. That's not hyperbole. That is exactly where the Ryan tax-and-budget plan Orwellianly called the ""Path to Prosperity"" would ultimately lead.
<p>Not immediately, of course. They're smarter than that. They know they can't dismantle the Great Society and New Deal programs all at once. Any more than they can get rid of all the financial or environmental or health and safety regulations all at once. Instead, they do their shredding piecemeal. But their ultimate goal is to get us back to where we were with income tax rates on the rich and social spending for the rest of us set at the level of 1925. The days before unemployment insurance, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, cash and housing assistance for poor families, Headstart, Pell Grants and food stamps. Days when income and wealth inequality were peaking, union organizing was illegal and the vast majority of workers only dreamed of an eight-hour workday.</p>
<p>For the plutocrats, <em>that</em> was the good old days.</p>
<p>The Ryan plan, the Romney plan, the Republican plan would shred a broad range of programs, the goal being more shredding later. Food stamp funding would, for example, be <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3717"">chopped and capped</a> and turned into a block grant to the states. Their plan wouldn't end the food stamp program?called SNAP in 26 states for the past four years?but would weaken it substantially. That's the case with other parts of the safety net, too. As Grover Norquist understands, bathtub drownings take time.</p>
<p>Now I have to be fair. Mitt Romney says he <em>likes</em> Big Bird. So, surely he doesn't want to actually see him in a soup line. He'd rather see him in a job. A private-sector job. What could a laid-off 43-year-old of dubious ethnicity with a single line on his résumé expect when his severance pay ran out? Maybe he could occasionally get one of those street-corner jobs waggling a sign directing people to a grand opening of condos or a Wal-Mart. Given its part-time, sporadic nature, it's not the kind of job that would make Big Bird eligible for unemployment insurance, but that's a good thing because we wouldn't want him to become government dependent.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney cuts in the dinner line at his own house and finishes eating before those last in the queue even get their food. You'll excuse me if I find the image of him sitting down with his kids or grandkids to watch ""Sesame Street"" just a tad hard to imagine. So, on second thought, his claim to actually like the yellow fellow is probably akin to his other campaign pronouncements, bogus.</p>
<p>What's not bogus is his desire as would-be president to gut government programs?big and small?while initiating yet another round of cutting taxes for corporations and the rich. Then, when the revenue that is supposed to flow from this effort doesn't appear, he (and his successors) can argue the need to cut even deeper into government spending (except the Pentagon) because we ""can't afford it."" Quite the scam. Sadly, there are some Democrats who buy it.</p>
<p>But not ""Big Bird Democrats."" That's the label Kossack <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/comments/1140719/47824518#c4"">Positronicus</a> created Saturday night. Big Bird Democrats get it. We know what Romney, Ryan and the Republicans are up to. We know how screwed up it is when some Democrats choose to ""compromise"" with these guys.</p>
<p>That's how we all wind up in the soup line.</p>

<td>For a candidate whose first foray into elective politics was met with an enviable raft of prominent endorsers (Mitt Romney, former Governor Pete Wilson, and John McCain) and a ton of free media, the past two weeks have been absolutely brutal for California Republican Meg Whitman. The alleged frontrunner for the GOP nomination for Governor in the Golden State, her introduction to the political stage has been pure amateur hour.
<p>It started with a Sacramento Bee investigative story, which outlined an almost comically sparse voting history for the first-time candidate. The same weekend as that revelation became known, Whitman was blasted in a straw poll at the state GOP convention by state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner.</p>
<p>Then, last week, Whitman tried to explain her proclivity for electoral absenteeism, and dug herself in deeper, making the rather silly excuse that she was too busy raising a family to register to vote.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">On Wednesday night, Romney debated his formerly conservative self.</div>
</div>
By most accounts, Mitt Romney scored a clear victory over President Obama at the first presidential debate this past Wednesday evening. The jury is <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140038/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Polling-Wrap-Earliest-post-debate-polling-hints-at-minimal-boost-for-Romney?detail=hide"">still out</a> on how much polling bounce, if any, the Republican nominee will gain from his performance: Good debate performances don't necessarily translate to improvements in poll numbers, after all; and while the Romney campaign will certainly enjoy a boost of energy, media fact-checkers were none too pleased with his <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140032/-What-the-real-Romney-plan-would-do-nbsp-to-nbsp-Medicare?detail=hide"">outright mendacity</a> on many issues, while President Obama's campaign is already trying to make up for an uninspired performance by <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140178/-For-those-who-don-t-think-Romney-s-Big-Bird-moment-is-a-major-thing?showAll=yes"">hitting Romney hard</a> on his desire to take Big Bird off the air.
<p>In the context of Mitt Romney's quest for the presidency, however, a debate win is a debate win, no matter what. If Romney had been perceived to have lost on Wednesday night, pundits would have been hammering even more nails into his campaign's coffin. Regardless of whatever fact-checks and recriminations may follow, then, Romney did what he needed to do. But the larger problem for his party and his ideology (or at least, what everyone thought his ideology was) is that his win came at the explicit cost of conservatism.</p>
<p>The past few months of campaigning had left one thing crystal clear: The severely conservative version of Mitt Romney stood very little chance of winning. Before his most recent upgrade, the previous release of Mitt Romney featured a pick of the arch-conservative Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee. His signature economic policy was a $5 trillion tax cut that would somehow pay for itself. He, like his party, had been a crusader against regulation. He famously wrote off 47 percent of the American population as being lazy moochers, and then <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/02/1138751/-Aide-Romney-prepared-to-address-his-47-comment-during-debate-with-100-nonsense&amp;quot"">defended those comments</a>. The severely conservative Romney wanted to repeal Obamacare because it was a massive government intrusion, and if that meant elimination of coverage for pre-existing conditions, well, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/10/1129929/-Behind-all-the-flip-flops-Romney-will-leave-tens-of-millions-without-nbsp-insurance"">too bad</a>.</p>
<p>According to master prognosticator Nate Silver at <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/"">FiveThirtyEight</a>, severely conservative Romney had a roughly 13 percent chance of winning the election as of Wednesday night. So picture this: It's 34 days before the election, and you're Mitt Romney. The poll numbers are looking bleak, and unlike the conservative base, you know they're not skewed. Donors are on the verge of abandoning your race. You have one last best chance to impress the American people and win them over. So what do you do? Why, abandon conservatism, of course.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Not a nice guy</div>
</div>
President Obama is an astute political junkie like any other astute political junkie, except that he is president, which means he is rather busy, and it is therefore possible that he hasn't had the time to pay enough attention to really understand the personality of Mitt Romney. It is possible that he hasn't had the time to pay enough attention to really comprehend just how depraved Mitt Romney is. Almost all politicians lie, and the greater their ambitions, and the higher they climb on the rungs of political hierarchy, the greater are the odds that lying will become taken for granted as but another of their basic political skills. All presidents lies. All presidents have lied. All nominees to be president have lied. This is a given. This is no surprise. But Mitt Romney isn't any ordinary liar.
<p>Four years ago, then-Sen. Obama faced still-Sen. McCain, and of course being a skilled and astute political junkie and politician, Obama understood that McCain would tell an occassional lie. McCain revealed himself as cranky, and at times nasty, but he never was more than a garden-variety Republican liar. Nothing special, in that regard. Mitt Romney is different. Mitt Romney tells lies as naturally as he breathes. His entire <a href=""http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/08/20/13376256-the-post-truth-campaign-continues-apace?lite"">campaign</a> is <a href=""http://romneytheliar.blogspot.com/"">constructed of lies</a>. His entire <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-federal-bailout-that-saved-mitt-romney-20120829"">identity</a> is <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mitt-romney-expensive-olympics-federal-funding"">constructed of lies</a>. Mitt Romney wouldn't find the truth if given a map, a compass, GPS and professional guides, because Mitt Romney isn't even interested in finding the truth.</p>
<p>President Obama's problems in the first debate were twofold, and one was about style and the other substance. On style, the president seemed too passive and reserved, while Romney seemed like he had had an extra couple cups of coffee, which may not be something to which Romney is habituated. He seemed hyped. Like a frenetic gerbil. And while at least some weren't charmed by his <a href=""https://twitter.com/politicoroger/statuses/253673625876582401"">running roughshod</a> over the <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/10/04/jim_lehrer_useless/"">hapless Jim Lehrer</a>, most of the pundits and a good majority of the viewers seem to think he came off as aggressive and passionate.</p>
<p>The second problem for President Obama was that he seemed unprepared to deal with someone as gleefully mendacious as Romney, and if there was one characteristic that best defined Romney's demeanor during the debate, it was his glee.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Yeah, we know you dislike the gays, but let's get specific about how much.</div>
</div>
No questions about gay rights were included in the domestic policy debate Wednesday.
<p>On one level, this is understandable. The choice for those who actually care at all about LGBT equality is clear: Barack Obama. <strong>Full stop.</strong></p>
<p>But on another level, considering the extraordinary progress that has been made of late, the topic of LGBT rights deserves to be examined, precisely because it has been a big part of the story of the last four years.</p>
<p>And voters deserve to know the priorities of these two men who wish to lead the country. Consider how much time Speaker Boehner's Republican House has spent passing bills regulating women's lady parts and micro-managing gay people's lives since midterms. Stacks and stacks of bills, because <a href=""https://www.washingtonblade.com/2012/07/20/house-oks-measure-aiming-to-end-same-sex-weddings-on-military-bases/"">gay people getting married on military bases</a> is the most pressing issue Republicans can think to address today.</p>
<p>Moreover, how the country proceeds in the recognition of marriage rights for LGBT citizens is not some ethereal, academic hypothetical. It's now. It's happening. It is coming squarely down the pike. There are a handful of cases at this very moment being considered by the Supreme Court, and a Constitutional challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act is almost certainly going to be heard in the high court next year.</p>
<p>However the Supreme Court rules, the decision is going to crash into the first year of next administration with the force of a cultural freight train just about June 2013. And whoever is in charge is going to be called upon to react.</p>
<p>This week, Paul Ryan spoke with <a href=""http://www.glaad.org/cap/jim-daly"">virulently homophobic Focus on the Family president Jim Daly</a> and according to <a href=""http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/paul-ryan-promises-focus-family-fight-gay-equality"">Right Wing Watch</a>, ""reassured the anti-gay group that a Romney-Ryan administration will fiercely oppose gay rights.""</p>
<p>There's no debate, LGBT progress will be greatly stymied under President Romney. But preventing progress isn't enough for his base, they ""want their country back"" and not just from the black people, from the rainbow people too. The question is, <strong>how far is Romney willing to go to turn back the clock for gays?</strong> How many of the administrative changes that Obama has implemented will he revoke? And which ones, specifically?</p>
<p>Romney has pretty much promised to undo everything else Obama has accomplished over the last four years. And even people who don't care too much one way or the other about LGBT progress (which might possibly even represent a majority), deserve to know how much time and energy the Romney administration would task to undoing the collective progress. The collateral damage will be their president piddling away his political capital to extend the last throes of the right wing's failing culture war.</p>
<p>LGBT rights is also another area to push Romney to be specific?something he tries desperately to avoid on all topics. In the political discourse the effective result of not asking him to get specific on LGBT policies is Mitt Romney getting a free pass to promise crazy things to crazy people and no one really thinks twice about the crazy implications. Take, for example, his promise to amend the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>After the fold, a host of very specific questions candidate Romney might be asked at the next debate on issues of importance to the LGBT community and their families in 2012.</p>

<p>So how much time was spent discussing it, during the first presidential debate? <a href=""http://profmandia.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/obama-romney-pbs-let-americans-down-big-time/"">None</a>.

<blockquote>GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney?s big rally Monday in Denver turned out thousands of cheering, pumped up fans at the Wings over the Rockies Air and Space Museum ? an event that provided a last very dramatic public stand before Wednesday?s debate at the University of Denver.
<p>There was a ?huh?? moment: country singer Laurie Morgan serenading the crowd with ?Dixie? ? those ?I wish I were in the land of cotton? lyrics not too often heard at modern day presidential campaign events.</p>
</blockquote>
Which is about as cautious and tame a description as is possible. A more honest description would be that the song first attained popularity in blackface minstrelsy. That it was the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy. That it was a favorite among opponents of the 1960s Civil Rights movement. That it is the unofficial theme song of <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/04/08/855319/-By-All-Means-Let-s-Remember-The-Confederacy?detail=hide"">Civil War revisionists</a>.
<p>Romney, of course, neither criticized nor apologized for this outrage. Nor, apparently, did anyone from his campaign. No doubt they will describe Morgan's serenade as but innocent fun. Like Romney's charming <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2012-08-25/opinion/opinion_brazile-romney-birther-line_1_mitt-romney-birther-years-of-tax-returns"">birther joke</a>. The question being what exactly the song ""Dixie"" has to do with Romney, who is not a Southerner, or with Denver or Colorado, which are not in the South. What is the context? What is the rationale? What could it <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/04/16/720849/-They-Hate-Him-Because-He-Is-Black?detail=hide"">possibly be</a>?</p>

<li>Maybe if our television media responsibly reported the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/19/1066069/-A-brief-guide-to-the-scientific-consensus-on-climate-change?detail=hide"">scientific facts</a> rather than <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/04/16/study-climate-coverage-plummets-on-broadcast-ne/184103"">dishonestly playing it</a> as but another open political debate, <a href=""http://www.france24.com/en/20121004-climate-scepticism-highest-us-britain"">this dangerous embarrassment</a> wouldn't be true:<br />

(The dumbest question of the night!) ?Obamacare?? ?Do you guys have a rhetorical disagreement about the impossibly amorphous concept of ?the role of government???? And finally ?how would you fix partisan gridlock??
<p>So! Sorry, immigration, reproductive health, LGBT civil rights, the environment, campaign finance, the drug war, and voting rights: None of you matter as much as Simpson effing Bowles! (But do you begin to understand why Beltway pundit and commentator types loved this debate so much? It hit all their pet topics!) ?Are there too many regulations? is more important than ?do you think we should maybe do anything at all to address catastrophic climate change.? (Not that either candidate wants to talk about that.)</p>

<p>Far from being tamed, parliamentary legitimacy appears only to have emboldened the extremists. In recent weeks racially-motivated attacks have proliferated.

<p>One survey last week showed a near doubling in the number of people voicing ""positive opinions"" about Golden Dawn, up from 12% in May to 22%. The popularity of Nikos Michaloliakos, the party's rabble-rousing leader had shot up by 8 points, much more than any other party leader.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">No Stone Unturned: The Life and Times<br />
of Maggie Kuhn, by Maggie Kuhn</div>
</div>
<em>""Old age is an excellent time for outrage. My goal is to say or do at least one outrageous thing every week""</em> is a quotation often attributed to Maggie Kuhn, the founder of <a href=""http://graypanthers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=17"">The Gray Panthers</a>.
<p>When I got my Medicare card this last August and officially became a senior citizen, I rushed off to begin claiming senor discounts in local stores. I started thinking about how those of us who are older are stereotyped. Old folks get hit with everything but the kitchen sink in negatives. We are castigated for being stuck in a conservative rut, and charged with every ""ism"" in the bigot basket. Old lady and old man jokes abound.</p>
<p>I can remember being afraid to start blogging at age 60 simply because I thought everyone who blogged was young and living in their parents' basements eating Cheetos. How's that for stereotyping? What could I possibly have in common with young bloggers?</p>
<p>I was wrong, and pleasantly surprised to find a lot of us from my generation and older right here at Daily Kos, and a great range of ages at <a href=""http://www.netrootsnation.org/"">Netroots Nation</a>. More of us who have been on the front lines of organizing and fighting for decades are putting our arthritic fingers to the keyboard and sharing our experience and insights with many of you who may be younger, or the age of our grandkids, if we have them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to celebrate us today, and focus on that group we put in the ""elderly or senior"" box in polling data. Starting with the woman who put the term ""ageism"" into our vernacular?Maggie Kuhn.</p>
<p>PBS highlighted her life and the Gray Panther Movement in a documentary now distributed by Women Make Movies called <a href=""http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c609.shtml"">MAGGIE GROWLS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>Maggie Kuhn was never afraid to march to her own beat and fight for what she believed. Born in Buffalo in 1905, she was a passionate social activist right from the start. Maggie entered the workplace in 1926, with a job at the YWCA in Cleveland, organizing poor and working women. In 1950, she began a 20-year stint in the Social Education and Action Office of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A. It was a job she adored, one that kept her in the forefront of the social activist movement for decades. When she turned 65 and was forced to give up the career she loved, Maggie decided that she would not fade away quietly. Saying ""don't agonize, organize,"" and reminding them that they had nothing to lose, she galvanized a group of friends and colleagues who had also been put prematurely out to pasture and launched the career for which she is renowned: as founder and leader of the Gray Panthers.
<p>Maggie's second career unfolded in television appearances with Johnny Carson; on Capitol Hill, chiding senators and congressmen; and on the picket line, fighting injustice for all people, wherever she could. She also spoke fondly of her many love affairs and close friendships. Maggie's insistence on talking publicly about sex, which often made her listeners squirm, lead to a serious re-thinking about what growing old was all about. As Maggie said, ""Sex and learning end only when rigor mortis sets in.""</p>
<p>In an era replete with ""movements,"" the media quickly latched onto Maggie. Looking like the stereotypical sweet little old lady, when Maggie spoke, people listened. With a disarming mixture of humor, shock value and common sense, Maggie deftly used her high visibility to combat media stereotypes that denigrated the elderly and went on to champion universal health care, nursing home reform, shared housing and consumer protection. MAGGIE GROWLS looks at the forces that shaped the movement as well as its leader, using Maggie's life as a lens through which to examine the intertwined issues of social reform and aging in America.<br /></p>

<p>Read her autobiography, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/No-Stone-Unturned-Times-Maggie/dp/0345373731""><em>No Stone Unturned: The Life and Times of Maggie Kuhn</em></a> and the excellent study of a movement, <a href=""http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14626.html""><em>Gray Panthers</em></a>, by anthropologist Roger Sanjek which should give you some new insights into us ""wrinkled radicals.""</p>
<p>I spend quite a few mornings each month checking into <a href=""http://margaretandhelen.com/"">Margaret and Helen's</a> blog, to see what those two intrepid and acerbic oldsters have to say about recent events.</p>
<p>They do not disappoint. Helen had plenty to say about the first presidential debate. I savor her opening salvo.</p>
<blockquote>Well Margaret, once again I am going to say what the media won?t. Mitt Romney is a lying sack of shit and he wouldn?t know a middle class tax cut if it bit him in the middle of his gold plated ass.</blockquote>

<br />
<p>As the curator of the Daily Kos Elections Polling Wrap, one trend in the 2012 electoral cycle that has not escaped my attention has been the relative paucity of polling in this presidential election cycle, when compared to other cycles.</p>
<p>For example, in 2008, there were 2,730 polls released in either presidential or downballot races, not counting national or primary polls. This year, despite having a much better method of gathering polling data (to say nothing of the assistance of the rest of the Daily Kos Elections team, something I did not have in 2008), this election year has brought just over 1,450 polls to-date. To put it another way, to merely match 2008's polling output, we would need to average a release of about 300-350 polls per week for the rest of the cycle. That is, suffice to say, unlikely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we learned this week that the 2012 polling blackout is going to extend to what every losing candidate colloquially refers to as ""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/04/networks-ap-cancel-exit-polls-in-19-states/"">the only poll that matters</a>"":<br /></p>
<blockquote>Breaking from two decades of tradition, this year?s election exit poll is set to include surveys of voters in 31 states, not all 50 as it has for the past five presidential elections, according to multiple people involved in the planning.
<p>Dan Merkle, director of elections for ABC News, and a member of the consortium that runs the exit poll, confirmed the shift Thursday. The aim, he said, ?is to still deliver a quality product in the most important states,? in the face of mounting survey costs.</p>
<p>The decision by the National Election Pool ? a joint venture of the major television networks and The Associated Press ? is sure to cause some pain to election watchers across the country.</p>
</blockquote>
While mournful, the decision nevertheless had seemed somewhat inevitable. With rising costs, and dwindling resources, we have already seen the major media outlets make slashing cuts to their polling budgets, with few media outlets even polling weekly, with only a month to go until the election.
<p>The criteria for inclusion and exclusion is predicated solely on the presidential race, it would seem. One imagines that the typical consumer of the media outlets only cares about the presidential race, and that gives the NEP the green light to cut states that are generally conceded to be safely in the corner of either President Obama or Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>With this in mind, these were the 20 entities (including the District of Columbia) that were summoned to the polling guillotine by the media outlets:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.</blockquote>
The casual observer might look at this collection of states and say, ""So what? These are all dark-red and dark-blue states. What is the big deal?""

There's a lot of big money behind California's Proposition 32, which should tell you right away how much to believe its backers' claims that the ballot initiative is about getting money out of politics. Most recently, Charles Munger, Jr., the son of the vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, this week gave <a href=""http://blogs.sacbee.com/the_state_worker/2012/10/charles-munger-doubles-down-to-defeat-prop-30-support-prop-32.html"">$9.9 million</a> to a committee aimed at simultaneously supporting Prop. 32 and defeating Gov. Jerry Brown's tax measure; Munger has now given a total of $20 million to those two fights. Meanwhile, good-government groups like the <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/10/league-of-women-voters-stars-in-new-prop-32-ad.html"">League of Women Voters</a> are lining up against Prop. 32 along with the unions it explicitly targets.
<p>Prop. 32 eliminates a key union fundraising tool. Then it restricts direct contributions to candidates by unions and some kinds of corporations. That's meant to look like ""getting special interest money out of politics,"" in the hope that you won't notice that corporate big money could still put unlimited amounts of money into outside spending and Super PACs, while unions would have lost the ability to compete financially (to the small extent they currently do). California Republicans are hoping that if this passes, they'd finally be able to start winning statewide elections.</p>
<p>Munger is not the only super-rich guy supporting Prop. 32. According to Frying Pan News, the go-to source for reporting on who's behind this initiative, other major donors include <a href=""http://fryingpannews.org/2012/09/13/meet-john-dough-proposition-32s-top-donors/"">major supporters of Prop. 8</a> and of <a href=""http://fryingpannews.org/2012/10/02/an-education-how-prop-32s-backers-have-tried-to-ditch-public-schools/"">education privatization via vouchers</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, Larry T. Smith, ""a prominent proponent of 'gay-to-straight' conversion therapy for minors ... personally donated $50,000 to help support Prop. 8 and funneled even more money to the campaign through his political action group, the Family Action PAC."" Fellow Prop. 32 donor Howard Ahmanson gave $1.4 million to Prop. 8, as well as giving ""millions to both creationist and school-voucher causes."" Also on the school vouchers front, Timothy C. Draper has given $100,000 to support Prop. 32:<br /></p>
<blockquote>In 2000 Draper was the brains and the piggybank behind Proposition 38?arguably the most extreme school voucher effort in recent American history. The measure would have drained California public school coffers to give students up to $4,000 in taxpayer-funded vouchers to pay for private schools. The bill included no means testing, so that children of privilege who were already attending California?s prep schools would be given an unneeded subsidy for their elite education.</blockquote>
Likewise, ""Former Univision CEO Jerry Perenchio gave $1,040,000 to back Prop. 38 and to date has donated $250,000 to Prop. 32."" He's also a big donor to Karl Rove's American Crossroads.

<p>""Ah, Biden,"" he said, walking briskly across the eagle at the center of the carpet. ""Here. See what you make of this.""</p>
<p>I took the folded paper from his outstretched had and began to read.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/douthat-it-could-be-his-party.html"">Ross Douthat</a></p>
<blockquote>What Romney executed on Wednesday night was not just a simple pivot to the center ... what he did was clarify, elevate and translate. He clarified what kind of tax reformer he would be, by promising that revenue neutrality would take priority over sweeping cuts for the rich ? a premise that plenty of Republicans are already happy to accept. ... And he translated the basic free-market vision to a nonideological audience, by talking more about decent jobs than heroic job creators, and more about the struggling middle class than about the supposedly persecuted John Galts.</blockquote>
I stared at the words and scowled. ""But Obama,"" I said. ""Romney has never expressed any concern for the middle class, and neither has this Douthat fellow.""
<p>""Precisely,"" said Obama. &nbsp;""In fact, Mr. Romney's opinions are well known to fall firmly in line with this sentiment."" With this he indicated the next item on the creased sheet of newsprint.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/republicans-to-cities-drop-dead.html"">Kevin Baker</a></p>
<blockquote>The Republican Party is, more than ever before in its history, an anti-urban party, its support gleaned overwhelmingly from suburban and rural districts ? especially in presidential elections. ... For Republicans, cities became object lessons on the shortcomings of activist government and the welfare state ? sinkholes of crime and social dysfunction, where Ronald Reagan?s ?welfare queens? cavorted in their Cadillacs. ...
<p>The national Republican Party still can?t get seem to get past its animus toward the very idea of urban life. The only place that Amtrak turns a profit is the Northeast corridor ? yet all Republicans can think to do is privatize it, along with the local rail lines on which millions of Americans have been commuting into cities to work for as long as a century and a half. Republicans promise to ban same-sex marriage, make it easier for anyone to get a gun, delegitimize and destroy what they mockingly call ?public employees? unions,? and deport the immigrant workers performing so many thankless but vital tasks.</p>
<p>In short, they promise to rip and tear at the immensely complex fabric of city life while sneering at the entire ?urban vision of dense housing and government transit.? There is a terrible arrogance here that has ramifications well beyond the Republicans? electoral prospects.</p>
</blockquote>
Scanning the page, I found myself nodding in agreement. ""Yes, that certainly fits the Republican Party I know. Dismissive of most Americans, working to benefit only a few.""
<p>Obama folded his hands behind his back and stared at the rain splattered window. &nbsp;""And yet the man I shared a stage with this week professed none of those positions. How are we to reconcile this, Biden?"" A frown creased his strong features, and as it did I peered down at the words of</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/friedman-can-i-phone-a-friend.html"">Thomas Friedman</a></p>
<blockquote>Maybe we should have seen this coming. For weeks, Romney had performed so badly and had fallen so far behind in swing states that if this campaign were a Ryder Cup singles match, you?d have said the president felt he had the match in the bag with just a few holes left to play. So he did the worst thing you can do in match play golf: he started playing not to lose. He continued with an uninspired, vague and cautious campaign and just waited for Romney to keep hitting balls out of bounds. Romney, his back to the wall, had no choice but to start aggressively playing to win.</blockquote>
""Good lord,"" I exclaimed. ""What a supercilious asshole.""
<p>Obama broke into a grin as he turned back to me. ""Reading Friedman, are you? Well, Biden, there are some things that never change. &nbsp;But see here..."" &nbsp;He took another paper from his desk and passed it across to me.</p>
<p>""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-obama-was-kod-in-denver/2012/10/05/bbc5c5d4-0f23-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_story.html"">Parker</a>?"" I asked, shaking my head. ""But I thought she didn't agree with Romney.""</p>
<p>""She doesn't. She never has."" &nbsp;He took the paper back sand strolled across the floor more slowly. ""Think on this, Biden. &nbsp;Willard Romney has spent months, even years, building up the story that he is a 'severe conservative'. &nbsp;He opposes improving health care, wants massive tax cuts for the rich, and desires little more than to decimate the programs that middle class Americans most favor."" Obama's pacing had brought him once again close to the window. He stared out, past his own reflection, into the gloom of the day. &nbsp;""And yet conservatives have done nothing but proclaim that Romney must move ever further to the right.""</p>
<p>""Well, yes. Of course.</p>
<p>""But the man who I met the other night took positions exactly the opposite. He disavowed every belief conservatives hold dear.""</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt cold fingers run along my spine. ""You can't mean... Someone has kidnapped Romney and substituted a reasonable man!""</p>
<p>Obama waved a dismissive hand. ""Of course not. Mitt Romney is simply a serial liar, willing to say whatever he thinks people want to hear at that moment. In that, he is absolutely consistent. We've learned nothing about Romney we didn't already know.""</p>
<p>I frowned again in confusion. ""But then, Obama, where is the mystery?""</p>
<p>""The mystery, my good Biden, is in the reaction of conservative Republicans."" He gave the page in his hand a shake. ""You see, despite all the claims about the importance of their positions, conservatives were willing to renounce their beliefs in a trice when it appeared they might gain advantage."" With a quick flip of his wrist, Obama sent the folded page spinning across the room where It landed quite neatly in a bin. ""It's not Romney that revealed himself as having no positions worth noting -- that much we knew already. &nbsp;It's the Republican Party that went missing on that stage.""</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Attorney General Eric Holder</div>
</div>
Here's a big win for Eric Holder, Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama. It's also evidence of how this administration really is <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/APbaee27d23e1e4d37b95c34f3f39eb100.html"">protecting Medicare</a>.<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON ? A federal strike force has charged 91 people, including a hospital president, doctors and nurses, with Medicare fraud schemes in seven cities involving $429 million in false billings. [...]
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that that in addition to the newly announced criminal charges, her agency used new authority under the Obama administration's health care law to stop future payments to many of the health care providers suspected of fraud.</p>
</blockquote>
Those charged include the president of a hospital in Houston along with six others who racked up $158 million in fraudulent billings, two doctors and two nurses in Dallas who for $103 million in fraudulent billings, and a doctor and four chiropractors in Brooklyn, who participated in a scheme netting $23 million. The other cases are in Baton Rouge, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. The <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/business/medicare-fraud-charged-against-91.html"">charges</a> include ""billing the government for unnecessary ambulance rides in California, writing prescriptions for patients in Dallas who did not qualify for them and paying kickbacks like food and cigarettes to patients in Houston if they attended programs for which a hospital could bill.""
<p>When politicians talk about waste, fraud and abuse, this is what they're talking about. And the Obama administration is actually doing something about it, cracking down on the fraud, but using Obamacare to prevent providers caught in fraud from ever gaming the system again.</p>

<p>He simply sends them a copy of the president?s birth certificate. [?]</p>
<p>?Since President Obama was elected, many individuals have expressed concerns regarding his citizenship and eligibility to serve as the President of the United States given the requirements delineated in the Constitution,? one of the letters says. ?On April 27, 2011, in response to these criticisms, President Obama released the long form of his birth certificate, which was issued by the Hawaii State Department of Health.?</p>
</blockquote>
Staple the birth certificate to that, boom, done. Good answer. Now can we <em>please</em> get back to deciding which of our grandmothers deserve Medicare and which don't, like decent, rational Americans? Sheesh.<br />

<p>Republicans and their media water-carriers are <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/05/1140826/-Jack-Welch-Dick-Nixon-and-the-Great-BLS-Jobs-Conspiracy"">apoplectic</a> about Friday's report showing the unemployment rate dipped to 7.8 percent in September as the U.S. economy added 114,000 new jobs. But while many conservatives have been quick to follow in Richard Nixon's footsteps in accusing the career civil servants at the BLS of cooking the books for President Obama by showing more robust employment growth this summer, there is one jobs report no Republican wants to talk about. Because in the spring of 2011, the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Economic Analysis revealed that the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/14/1045367/-Obama-on-the-Economy-We-Didn-t-Know-How-Bad-It-Was"">Bush recession was far more severe</a> than the incoming Obama administration knew at the time or Republicans want to admit now.</p>
<p>In late 2008, Barack Obama's transition team led by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein began planning the President-elect's response to the near collapse of the American financial system that fall. In readying what in February 2009 would become the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Romer and Bernstein estimated that unemployment would peak at 8 percent with the stimulus--and 9 percent without it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only much later did Obama's team--and the American people--learn just how catastrophic the U.S. economic situation was at the beginning of 2009.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/08/fiscal-policy"">The Economist</a> and the <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/could-this-time-have-been-different/2011/08/25/gIQAiJo0VL_blog.html"">Washington Post's Ezra Klein</a> explained, in early 2009 the American economy was not only in much worse shape than anyone imagined; it was literally on the brink of collapse. As The Economist explained the run-up to the passage of the $787 billion recovery program:<br /></p>
<blockquote>The White House looked at the economic situation, sized up Congress, and took its shot. Unfortunately, the situation was far more dire than anyone in the administration or in Congress supposed.
<p>Output in the third and fourth quarters fell by 3.7% and 8.9%, respectively, not at 0.5% and 3.8% as believed at the time. Employment was also falling much faster than estimated. Some 820,000 jobs were lost in January, rather than the 598,000 then reported. In the three months prior to the passage of stimulus, the economy cut loose 2.2m workers, not 1.8m. In January, total employment was already 1m workers below the level shown in the official data.</p>
</blockquote>
As Klein summed it up last year:<br />
<blockquote>The reality has been worse than the administration's nightmare scenario. Even with the stimulus, unemployment shot past 10 percent in 2009.
<p>To understand how the administration got it so wrong, we need to look at the data it was looking at.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the agency charged with measuring the size and growth of the U.S. economy, initially projected that the economy shrank at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 2008. Months later, the bureau almost doubled that estimate, saying the number was 6.2 percent. Then it was revised to 6.3 percent. But it wasn't until this year that the actual number was revealed: 8.9 percent. That makes it one of the worst quarters in American history. Bernstein and Romer knew in 2008 that the economy had sustained a tough blow; they didn't know that it had been run over by a truck.</p>

Listing the rights and protections that are common around the world but that American workers don't have is downright depressing. One of the big areas? The ability to <i>not</i> work when you need time off: paid sick leave, parental leave, family leave, and more. Since women take on disproportionate amounts of care work, these are all things that hit women harder than men, creating one more obstacle for women to climb over in building and keeping careers. These issues take a back seat for too many Democratic politicians; Republicans, meanwhile, outright oppose anything that gives workers control over when they work. But women are <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/02/paid-sick-leave_n_1933379.html?utm_hp_ref=tw"">pushing to get paid leave on the agenda</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Only one in five low-wage workers have paid sick leave, and 48 percent of all full-time workers in the private sector have no access to paid medical or family leave. Dozens of women at a women's health town hall at the White House in June expressed the dire need for a federally funded paid maternity leave program. And while President Barack Obama did include a $50 million State Paid Leave Fundin his 2011 budget, the issue of paid time off has largely been ignored by candidates in the current campaign season.
<p>Jessica Smith, a 26-year-old graduate student of social work at the University of Denver, has circulated a petition asking moderator Jim Lehrer to question Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney about paid sick days and family leave insurance policies at the first presidential debate on Wednesday.</p>
</blockquote>
Since parental leave is so hard to come by, discrimination during pregnancy is another issue women have to worry about. The <a href=""http://www.inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13903/a_bill_to_make_employers_less_mean_to_pregnant_women/"">Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</a>:<br />
<blockquote>builds on existing anti-discrimination laws by extending specific protections to pregnant employees. The legislation directs employers to ?make reasonable accommodations"" for an employee or job applicant's &nbsp;limitations stemming from ""pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,? unless this would pose ?undue hardship? on the business. In addition, as the New York Times' Motherlode explains, the law would bar employers from ""using a worker?s pregnancy to deny her opportunities on the job [or] force her to take an accommodation that she does not want or need.? The bill also directs the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to set regulations for implementing these laws, including ?a list of exemplary reasonable accommodations.""</blockquote>

The bill was introduced by <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/08/1089814/-House-Democrats-introduce-Pregnant-Workers-Fairness-Act?detail=hide"">House Democrats</a> in May and by Senate Democrats in September and it stands zero chance of passage as long as Republicans control the House and filibuster everything in the Senate.
<p>We're talking about basic rights, here. Staying home when you or a member of your family is sick and still being able to pay the bills. Not losing your job because you're pregnant. Things workers around the world can count on that American workers can only dream about. And it's a dream, not a reality, because Republicans (and, unfortunately, some Democrats, like New York City council Speaker <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/18/1111389/-Sick-leave-for-more-than-1-65-million-New-Yorkers-being-blocked-by-council-Speaker-Christine-Quinn?detail=hide"">Christine Quinn</a>) are standing in the way.</p>
<p>The only chance we have at things like paid sick leave is electing Democrats, and then beating the hell out of the Democrats, like Quinn, who still stand in the way. So just as it took years of organizing and multiple tries to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, that's what we have to be ready for here. But the only way to even take the first step of getting the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (a very limited bill just prohibiting discrimination, for crying out loud) to a vote in the House is to get the gavel back in the hands of Speaker Pelosi. We're fighting here to even get the main event.</p>
<p><a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/speakerpelosi?refcode=10_02_leaveblog"">Please give $3 to each of the candidates on our Speaker Pelosi Project list</a> so we can get in the fight to outlaw discrimination against pregnant workers and get paid sick leave for all of us.</p>

You know by now about Mitt Romney's plan to save a teeny-intsy-weenie part of the budget, one one-hundredth of one percent, by firing Big Bird. Because deficit. And tax cuts for rich people. And his love for firing people. Birds. Whatever.
<p>Did you know, though, that his tax plan would also mean <a href=""http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20121005/FREE/121009956"">charitable deductions</a> would largely disappear for middle class people? So no federal money, and no benefit for donors giving to PBS. He really hates that Big Bird.</p>
<p>But did you further know that pretty much every sitting Republican member of Congress has voted <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">repeatedly</a> to <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">defund</a> public broadcasting?</p>
<p>That's why our whole slate of House candidates is included in <a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/helltopay?refcode=10_06_blog"">Hell to Pay</a> this week. Because they voted against Big Bird. Against Cookie Monster and Elmo and Snuffleupagus.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, some of our &nbsp;<a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/helltopay?refcode=10_06_blog"">Hell to Pay</a> candidates responded.</p>
<p><b>Carol Shea Porter's (NH-01)</b> campaign wants you to know where her opponent's priorities lie, and it ain't with the children:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Why are Congressman Frank Guinta and Mitt Romney taking aim at Big Bird? Why did Congressman Guinta vote to end funding for something that teaches our little ones and helps families? Congressman Guinta said that one of his highest priorities was to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. &nbsp;In Congress, he has voted to do just that.
<p>Naomi Andrews, Campaign Manager for Carol Shea-Porter, released the following statement. &nbsp;""Congressman Guinta needs to say no to Big Oil subsidies and yes to Big Bird and the Corporation For Public Broadcasting.""</p>
</blockquote>
Some of our other candidates wrote to let us know who they'd miss most from Sesame Street, and why:
<p><b>Kathy Boockvar (PA-08):</b><br /></p>
<blockquote>""I'll have to go with Oscar the Grouch before my morning coffee, and Grover afterwards, after he comes to peace with his inner monster.""</blockquote>
<b>Lois Frankel (FL-22):</b><br />
<blockquote>""I know that Mitt Romney and his campaign co-chair? my opponent?want to tell Big Bird, Bert, Elmo and &nbsp;the rest of the gang on Sesame Street to hit the road. &nbsp;Elmo has always been my favorite and I would hate to see him unemployed because of Mitt Romney. All of us could learn a lot from Elmo's positive attitude and optimistic outlook. The 'Elmo quality' is something more people in Washington need to emulate and it's amazing that the Republican's are trying to throw it out into the cold.""</blockquote>
<b>Betty Sutton (OH-16):</b><br />
<blockquote>Elmo's character is about inclusiveness?about teaching all children that love is important- loving your neighbor?your friend. &nbsp;It's also about learning?from colors to safety?to bedtime routines and how to buy things in a store. He is a character that helps children learn about the world in a way I think we all strive to be?more accepting, more tolerant, more kind, and above all, more loving of the people around us.</blockquote>
<b>Pat Kreitlow (WI-07):</b><br />
<blockquote>""The Count?Because Bill Clinton proved we need math skills beyond grade school, and especially in Congress. Also, there's an acCOUNTability joke somewhere in there, but I won't do that to you Joan.""</blockquote>
<b>Annie Kuster (NH-01):</b>
<p><a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/helltopay?refcode=10_06_blog""><img align=""right"" alt=""Goal Thermometer"" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/i.actblue.com/page/helltopay/thermometer/dark-short.png"" /></a></p>
<blockquote>Favorite character: The Count
<p>Why: If House Republicans had the Count's accounting skills, perhaps they'd have done a better job reducing the deficit.</p>
</blockquote>
You can sure tell these folks aren't Republicans!
<p>Let's see how far we can go to strike a blow for Elmo and Oscar and the Count. And especially Bert and Ernie (you know know how much Republicans hate Bert and Ernie).</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">The beginning of an era of Mitt Romney being <s>bipartisan</s> the same entitled jerk he always is.</div>
</div>
Mitt Romney <a href=""http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/05/romney-takes-liberties-with-bipartisan-claims-about-past/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto"">made much</a> of his supposed bipartisan skills in Wednesday night's debate. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139793/-Mitt-Romney-Lying-to-victory?detail=hide"">By this time</a>, it may not surprise you to hear that he was stretching the truth.<br />
<blockquote>As a Republican governor whose legislature was 87 percent Democrats, he said, ""I figured out from Day 1 I had to get along, and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done."" The result, he said, was that ""we drove our schools to be No. 1 in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.""</blockquote>
Romney <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139858/-Massachusetts-schools-are-great-but-don-t-credit-Mitt-Romney-with-that?detail=hide"">didn't deserve credit</a> for Massachusetts schools that were already great when he became governor, the tax cuts include a number that came from the legislature, ""routine extensions of existing tax reductions that were due to expire,"" and two one-day sales tax holidays. Additionally, Romney was famous for raising fees on basically everything he could think of.
<p>And about that bipartisanship. Massachusetts state legislators, though heavily Democratic, were used to working with Republican governors. But while there were moments Romney worked with them successfully?passing the precursor to Obamacare, for instance?Massachusetts legislators by and large remember him as exactly the entitled jerk we see running for president now. One frequently cited example of that entitlement is the elevator in the State House that Romney reserved for himself, banning state legislators from using it. They also talk about the security ropes he had installed outside his office. And about how it was impossible to get a meeting with him and he didn't bother to learn the names of the legislators who he now tells us he worked so hard to get bipartisan with.</p>
<p>It's not just legislators, either. Romney also kept his distance from the state's <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/was-mitt-romney-a-good-governor/257942/"">mayors</a>:<br /></p>
<blockquote>John Barrett, who was mayor of the city of North Adams during Romney's governorship, described him Thursday as ""a governor who just ignored us, who didn't want our effort,"" saying he never met with mayors or sought their input. ""He believed that a PowerPoint presentation would solve all our problems,"" Barrett said.</blockquote>
One Democratic mayor did have a positive experience with Romney. <a href=""http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/2012/09/mass-revolt-mitt-romney-campaign-in-massachusetts/"">But</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When Kalisz relayed the story to his fellow mayors, though, a funny thing happened: Nobody believed him. ?They thought I was joking when I said he was physically in my office,? Kalisz says.</blockquote>
Taking a shared elevator and keeping it for himself, security ropes, refusing to meet with legislators and mayors. Sound like bipartisanship to you? And that was in a state mostly controlled by Democrats?Romney wouldn't face nearly the same pressure to work with Democrats when it comes to a sharply divided U.S. Congress. The meetings with Democrats that he claims would happen on Day One would be much more likely to happen on Day Never.

<a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82081.html#ixzz28RwkTyAH"">Culture of something</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The owner of a Denver restaurant who has received death threats after declining a visit by Mitt Romney said Friday that he ?could feel the hate in the air? at his business recently.
<p>?On Thursday, it was horrible,? Oscar Aguirre, the owner of Rosa Linda?s Mexican Cafe, told POLITICO. ?It was dead. Yesterday during lunch, you could feel the hate in the air.?</p>
</blockquote>
Aguirre's crime was that a Romney aide asked if they could hold an official Romney campaign event there, Aguirre said no thanks, and that was that. But that wasn't that, because he then started getting emails, and phone calls, from disgruntled conservatives put out that he would do such a horrible thing.
<p>It hasn't gotten quite as farcical as the ridiculousness that ensued after a Florida pizzeria owner hugged Barack Obama, leading to <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57509622-503544/bear-hug-pizza-man-becomes-subject-of-yelp-war/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CBSNewsHealthyLiving+%28CBS+News%3A+Healthy+Living%29"">a nationwide effort by dimwits to give him bad reviews on Yelp</a>, but anything that includes ""death threats"" is pretty damn bad.</p>
<p>On the other side of things, there was the bakery owner who declined a visit by Joe Biden. <a href=""http://www.wdbj7.com/news/wdbj7-radford-business-owner-declines-joe-bidens-request-to-stop-in-store-20120815,0,4370357.story"">It seems like that worked out better, yes?</a><br /></p>
<blockquote>Back at the bakery, a couple of guys said they'd hoped to see Biden and didn't care that the VP had been turned away.
<p>""I mean it really doesn't matter to me. Everyone has their own views so I love the food here anyway. I agree. Everybody's different so I could care less,"" said Spenser Critterton of Radford.</p>
</blockquote>
? and then Biden's secret service detail bought a bunch of cookies.
<p>Really, folks, it's fine if a small business does not want to host Giant Political Event-Type Thingy. There are many reasons why a business might not want to do such a thing. There are many reasons why they would. If you're getting worked up over <em>that</em>, you may need to consider whether you are investing your political time wisely.<br /></p>

The Obama campaign is highlighting Mitt Romney's debate lies in a web video. Given the volume of untruth we're talking about, a two-minute video can only skim the surface, but running through the big lies is brutal enough (shoot, the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140029/-Obama-ad-hammers-Romney-for-lying-about-his-tax-plan-during-debate?detail=hide"">ad</a> released Thursday that only touched on tax policy was pretty hard-hitting itself).

<li>Yet <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Health/boy-scout-bullied-denied-eagle-rank-gay/story?id=17401340#.UG_w1VFFs4m"">another embarrassing action</a> by the homophobic, theocratic Boy Scouts:<br />
<blockquote>Ryan Andresen has spent a decade completing the requirements for the coveted Eagle Scout award, and now that he is just about to turn 18 -- the cut-off date for attaining the highest honor -- his Boy Scout troop won't approve it because he is gay.
<p>His project, a ""tolerance wall,"" was inspired by the years of hazing he endured in middle school in Moraga, Calif., and later at Boy Scout summer camp, where his nicknames were ""Tinkerbell"" and ""faggot.""</p>
<p>""I had I had no idea what gay was at that point,"" said Andresen, who described hazing that included, among other rituals, having the word ""fag"" written in charcoal across his chest.</p>
</blockquote>
Yep. In the world of the Boy Scouts, bullies can get badges just fine. The people they bully? Not so much. ""Duty to God"" and all that.</li>
<li><a href=""http://esciencenews.com/articles/2012/10/04/abortion.rates.plummet.with.free.birth.control"">No, really:</a><br />
<blockquote>When women are given access to birth control at no cost, the rate of unintended pregnancies and abortions among them drops dramatically, according to a new study published on Thursday in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology.
<p>The Contraceptive Choice Project, conducted by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Mo., enrolled 9,256 women and teens from 14 to 45 years of age in the St. Louis area between 2007 and 2011. The participants were all uninsured, low-income, or otherwise determined to be at risk for unintended pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
You mean, when women have easy access to medication that will prevent pregnancies, pregnancies are prevented? What a shock!</li>
<li>For those keeping score at home, conservatives seem to think that President Obama is a lazy, shiftless and stupid black man who somehow has the capacity to arrange a wholesale conspiracy to fudge the Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report while leaving absolutely no evidence of ever having done so. Because, logic!</li>
<li>Steve Doocy <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/10/05/doocy-lawmaker-who-wont-pray-in-public-shouldnt-use-money-with-in-god-we-trust/"">is insane</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fox News co-host Steve Doocy on Friday suggested that Pennsylvania state lawmaker Babette Josephs (D) should not use U.S. currency that includes the words ?In God We Trust? because she has said that she does not pray in public.
<p>During a Pennsylvania House State Government Committee meeting on Wednesday, Josephs had declined to lead the Pledge of Allegiance because it included the words ?under God.?</p>
<p>?Based on my First Amendment rights and based on the fact that I really think it?s a prayer,? she explained. ?I don?t pray in public.?</p>

Remember that Doocy is the same jackass who wondered if the 47% percent deserve to be able to vote.</li>

<p>Some good news out of Los Angeles County. California just implemented online voter registration, and according to a release, about 60% of those who registered to vote in the county in the first week of its availability registered as Democrats:<br /></p>
<blockquote>LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles County Democratic Party (LACDP) reported that in the first week of online voter registration being available in California almost 60% of all those in LA County registered with the Democratic Party, and announced the next phase of the Party's outreach efforts focusing on spreading the word about registering to vote by mail online
<p>Eric C. Bauman, LACDP Chair and Vice-Chair of the California Democratic Party said, ""I'm proud to announce our new public awareness campaign to heavily push online vote-by-mail registration, because even a small increase in Democrats voting by mail will help us re-elect President Obama and Senator Feinstein, pass Prop 30, beat back Prop 32, make major gains in the State Assembly and Senate and put the Speaker's gavel back in Nancy Pelosi's hands.""</p>
<p>According to LA County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk Dean Logan, approximately 50,785 voters registered online during the first week of availability, 30,340 of which registered as Democrats.</p>
</blockquote>
This number may not seem hugely important because Los Angeles is a blue county--but as of a month ago, Democratic voter registration in the county was <a href=""http://rrcc.lacounty.gov/VOTER/PDFS/STATEMENT_REGISTRATION/09072012.pdf"">a shade over 50%</a>, which would make 60% of new registrants being Democrats a huge improvement.</li>
<li>A sane Republican? <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/10/05/964121/scott-tipton-enda/"">Who knew?</a><br />
<blockquote>DENVER, Colorado ? A Republican Congressman has broken with his party and announced his support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a key piece of legislation that would make it illegal to discriminate against LGBT individuals in the workplace.
<p>?I don?t believe we ought to be discriminating against people for their private lives,? Rep. Scott Tipton (R-CO) explained to ThinkProgress outside Wednesday?s presidential debate. ?I?m a businessman. When you walk in the door, if you?re able to do the job and you?re focused on your job, that?s all that?s important.""</p>

Last spring, student teachers at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/07/1089438/-For-profit-teacher-licensing-draws-resistance-from-Massachusetts-student-teachers?detail=hide"">refused to participate</a> in a pilot teacher licensing program that would replace real-life classroom observation with a take-home test and edited videos of the prospective teacher in the classroom. The new teacher licensing would be done for profit by testing company <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/29/1085807/-Testing-driven-education-means-giant-corporate-profits-and-pineapples-don-t-have-sleeves-?detail=hide"">Pearson</a>, and 67 of the 68 student teachers training for middle school and high school teaching at UMass said no. Within weeks, the director of the secondary-teacher education program who had trained them and had spoken out against the new licensing system got a letter saying her contract wouldn't be renewed when it expired a year later.
<p>The <i>New York Times</i>' Michael Winerip, who last spring wrote about the 67 students' refusal to film themselves for licensing by Pearson, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/booming/01winerip-booming.html?ref=michaelwinerip&amp;_r=0"">writes now</a> of Barbara Madeloni that:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Ms. Madeloni is 55 and has been overseeing the university?s program to train middle and high school teachers for nine years. During that time, she has repeatedly been rated ?outstanding.? (?We applaud Dr. Madeloni for her work,? read her December 2011 evaluation.) [...]
<p>?They?ve been angry at me for a long time, but I believe the article pushed them over the edge,? she said this week. ?For several years this has been building inside me, this reliance on standardized tests to evaluate teachers.</p>
<p>?It?s so degrading,? she said. ?For a long time I decided not to fight it. I wouldn?t have been able to do this at 40. I don?t think I could have stayed as grounded. You have to be able to manage people saying awful, awful things.?</p>
</blockquote>
The university administration insists the decision not to renew Madeloni's contract was completely unrelated to her anti-standardization activism and the publicity that resulted. (<a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/28/1114239/-This-week-in-the-War-on-Workers-Another-Hyatt-activist-is-out-of-work-Coincidentally-Hyatt-says?detail=hide"">It's always a coincidence!</a>) Ironically, the way the administration was able to get rid of her was to convert her position into a tenure-track one?so the next person hired to fill this role will be able to speak up from a less vulnerable position. But how much do you want to bet that they do their best to hire someone who'll be complacent?

<p>The biggest news this week came Tuesday when Republican Judge Robert Simpson, under pressure from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, <a href=""http://www.pacourts.us/NR/rdonlyres/CFBF4323-B964-4846-8179-88D689375C10/0/CMWSuppDetAppPrelInjOrder_100212.pdf"">blocked the most important part</a> of the state's much-disputed voter-ID law.</p>
<p>Simpson did not overturn the whole law (or his previous decision in the matter). In fact, the law is still valid. But for the November election, even though poll workers can ask for one of the few approved forms of ID, Pennsylvanians without one will be allowed to vote just like any other citizen. Before the ruling, they would have only been allowed to cast a provisional ballot. The court will further examine the law after the election.</p>
<p>Although a news agency reported that Republican Gov. Tom Corbett would not appeal the law to the state supreme court, and I repeated that report <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/03/1139233/-Voter-ID-laws-take-another-hit-in-Mississippi-no-appeal-coming-in-Pennsylvania-ruling"">here</a>, so far he has only said he is <em>leaning</em> in the direction of not appealing the ruling. One reason behind the reluctance to do so is no doubt the previous ruling by the high court that vacated the original decision by Judge Simpson. The wording of that ruling would seem to make any appeal unlikely of success.</p>
<p>State Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, the Republican legislator who pushed the law into existence isn't too happy. The judge's decision, Metcalfe <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/state/20121004_Ronnie_Polaneczky_.html"">said</a>, ""is skewed in favor of the lazy, who refuse to exercise the necessary work ethic to meet the common-sense requirements to obtain an acceptable photo ID.""</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has the strictest new voter-ID law in the country, but it is only one 15 states that have tightened their ID restrictions since 2008. Courts have approved the laws of three states?New Hampshire, Indiana and Georgia. In addition to Pennsylvania, court rulings or other legal action have at least temporarily blocked the laws in Texas, Wisconsin, Mississippi and South Carolina, although a federal court could change the situation depending on its ruling in the last case.</p>
<p>The laws, all of which were passed in GOP-dominated legislatures, place a discriminatory burden on the poor, minorities, the elderly and other citizens who vote heavily Democratic.</p>
<p>Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice, the nation's largest non-partisan &nbsp;source of voting rights research, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/us/pennsylvania-judge-delays-implementation-of-voter-id-law.html"">said</a>: ?Every voter restriction that has been challenged this year has been either enjoined, blocked or weakened. It has been an extraordinary string of victories for those opposing these laws.?</p>
<p>However, said Penda D. Hair, a co-director of the Advancement Project, one of several groups that challenged the law Pennsylvania law:<br /></p>
<blockquote>?While we?re happy that voters in Pennsylvania will not be turned away if they do not have an ID, we are concerned that the ruling will allow election workers to ask for ID at the polls, and this could cause confusion. This injunction serves as a mere Band-Aid for the law?s inherent problems, not an effective remedy.?</blockquote>
<div class=""dkimg-r""><span class=""image_container""><img alt=""Voter button"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/6907/small/NoVote.png?1348452168"" /></span></div>
In fact, Judge Simpson labeled this a ""soft run,"" according to <em>The New York Times.</em> Amy Davidson <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2012/10/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-delay.html#ixzz28P0kZwmM"">raised cogent points</a> in this regard:<br />
<blockquote>What effect will that have on people standing on line, who see those in front of them asked to produce something that they themselves might not be carrying? And Pennsylvania has an obligation now to make sure that all of the people who?ve been admonished to get their photo on a card now know that they don?t have to. No state, and no country, is better off for reducing civic participation?we have, if anything, an extra interest in making sure that the people least likely to keep waiting in a long line do so. A person who has spoken by voting is more likely to listen.</blockquote>
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party, Working America, the Voter ID Coalition and other groups that have been engaged in get-out-the-vote efforts, including informing citizens about the voter-ID requirements, <a href=""http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20121003_Activists_on_voter-ID_ruling__Happy_but_still_working.html"">have not packed up</a> their operations. The Voter ID Coalition, comprising 140 civic, educational, legal, community and religious groups, will be retooling their door-hangers and other materials with the idea that while voter-ID will not be required this time, next time it will.
<p>In addition, said Ellen Mattleman Kaplan, vice president of the Committee of Seventy, a century-old good-government group in Philadelphia, Simpson's ruling didn't change things for first-time voters or people voting for the first time in a new district. An older law already requires such citizens to show ID.</p>

And we?ve made too much progress to return to the policies that got us into this mess in the first place.</blockquote>
<div align=""center""></div>
<p>President Barack Obama trumpeted <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/05/1139397/-Government-reports-increase-of-114-000-official-rate-of-unemployment-drops-to-7-8-U6-is"">yesterday's jobs numbers</a> and for the third week in a row called on Americans to tell Congress to get back to work passing bills.</p>
<p>He pointed to tougher regulation of Wall Street and ""the strongest consumer protections in our history"" as accomplishments his administration pushed through?and ones Republicans are determined to tear down should they get the chance.<br /></p>
<blockquote>But for some reason, some Republicans in Congress are still waging an all-out battle to delay, defund and dismantle these commonsense new rules.
<p>Why? Do they think undoing rules that protect families from the worst practices of credit card companies and mortgage lenders will make the middle class stronger? Do they think getting rid of rules to prevent another crisis on Wall Street will make Main Street any safer?</p>
</blockquote>
Of course not. But if they want to at least pretend to be putting the interests of middle-class Americans first, he said, there are three things they can do:
<ul>
<li>Pass tax cuts for middle-class Americans</li>
<li>Pass mortgage refinancing legislation</li>
<li>Get a veterans job corps off the ground</li>
</ul>
<p>But that, of course, would require Congress to do its freaking job. So ?.<br /></p>
<blockquote>Ask them to get back to work and get these things done. If we?re going to keep this economy moving forward, there?s no time for political games. Even in a political season. Everyone needs to do their part. If you agree with me, let your Representative know where you stand. Tell them that if they want your vote, then they need to stand with you and not in the way of our recovery.</blockquote>

The Arctic isn't the only thing that's shrinking. New analysis comes to the shocking conclusion that half of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is gone. <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/03/947221/the-great-dwindling-barrier-reef-loses-half-its-coral-cover-in-under-30-years/"">The culprits</a>?
<blockquote>Yet according to this new study, the degradation is less directly linked to these usual suspects. Just 10 percent of the loss was attributable to bleaching. The study found coastal storms were the leading culprit that caused 48 percent of the damage, and the remaining 42 percent was a result of an exploding population of the crown of thorns starfish that preys on coral.
<p>Don?t mistake these causes for reason to think climate change isn?t responsible. After all, an increase in intensity of coastal storms is undoubtedly a symptom of planetary warming.</p>

<p>The graph below compares two-party vote share for Obama in 2008, by state, with last night's estimates from our model-based poll averaging. Pre-debate and nationwide, Obama was performing about a percentage point below the 2008 election result, from just over 53 percent (2008) to just over 52 percent (current estimate from our model-based poll averaging). Most states appear to be swinging away from Obama by a similar amount. This small amount of swing isn't translating into many states changing hands relative to 2008. A large win for Obama in the Electoral College is the clear implication of the current polling and our modeling.</p>

<p>In Utah, Scott Howell, a Democrat, has been arguing that if the 78-year-old Senator Orrin Hatch wins, he might ?die before his term is through.? Suggesting a longtime incumbent is over the hill is a venerable election technique, but you really are supposed to be a little more delicate about it. Howell also proposed having 29 debates.

David Dayen <a href=""http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/10/05/alan-simpson-i-get-so-damn-sick-and-tired-of-listening-to-the-little-guy/"">has encountered</a> a comment from Alan Simpson that ought to be bronzed and thrust into the face of every Democrat (including the one in the White House) who invokes the name of Simpson-Bowles in discussions of budgets and deficits:<br />
<br />
<table align=""center"" width=""96%"">
<tr>
<td>
<blockquote>SIMPSON: I get so damn sick and tired of listening to the little guy, the vulnerable, the veteran ? I am a veteran, and the seniors and this and this and this and the meanwhile this country is headed for second-class status while everybody just babbles into the vapor.</blockquote>
Where is the evidence that Alan Simpson has ever in his life listened to ?the little guy?? He?s really sick and tired of the PUBLIC listening to those pleas ? in other word, he doesn?t like the public thinking for themselves, with appeals from those who look and talk and think like them. He?d much rather the rest of the country worked the way it works in Washington, where the little guy remains silent while the blob of corporate lobbyists and consultants and associated grifters dominate the conversation. The vulnerable never penetrate the minds of the political class, save for maybe two or three weeks around election season. The rest of the time, they?re just 300 million moochers sucking at the public teat.
<p>Simpson really wants to shut down this thing we call democracy, so the enlightened, self-appointed guardians can go about looting the public treasury in peace. In your best interest.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is why Simpson was supposed to be put out to pasture, in favor of younger model Judd Gregg. But Washington has elevated Simpson and his balcony partner Erskine Bowles to such heights, and elevated their B-S plan (that stands for Bowles-Simpson, what else could it stand for) as well, that he couldn?t extricate himself from the spotlight. And these are the results.</p>

Bernard, senior fellow with the Independent Women's Forum. ""This attack by Eleanor Smeal and company is wholly unwarranted.""</p>
</blockquote>
IWF was the spin-off of Women for Clarence Thomas. Its first executive director was Barbara Ledeen, wife of Michael Ledeen. Among other notables who have served on its board are Rumsfeld hagiographer Midge Dector, who wrote a 1972 book called <i>The New Chastity and Other Arguments Against Women's Liberation,</i> Ted Olson and Larry Kudlow (yes, that Kudlow).
<p>The IWF mission: ?to combat the women-as-victim, pro-big-government ideology of radical feminism.?</p>

If today's rather modest amount of data is alarming or depressing to regular readers of the Polling Wrap, allow me to use, perhaps for the first time, a very old cliché: consider the source.
<p>Perhaps I, along with the universe of political junkies, should have seen this one coming. Less than 36 hours after the first presidential debate, the two most well-known right-leaning ""robopollsters"" in the game are out with swing state polls, culled from single-day samples. And their results, perhaps not surprisingly, have been exceptionally kind to the Republican nominee.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that they take pretty different approaches to their polls, even though the toplines are somewhat similar.</p>
<p>What is even more interesting is how badly one of those pollsters might have pissed away their credibility in their polling memo. You'll have to read it for yourself, it really is <i>that</i> bad.</p>
<p>For now, though, on to the numbers:<br /></p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Scott Brown talks about his model justice.</div>
</div>
Does Scott Brown agree with his <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/02/1138666/-Meet-Antonin-Scalia-Scott-Brown-s-kind-of-Supreme-Court-Justice"">model Supreme Court Justice</a>, Antonin Scalia, on these <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2012/10/05/scalia_says_outlawing_abortion_and_homosexual_sodomy_are_judicial_no_brainers/"">opinions he offered</a> at an American Enterprise Institute event this week?<br />
<blockquote>?The death penalty? Give me a break. It?s easy. Abortion? Absolutely easy. Nobody ever thought the Constitution prevented restrictions on abortion,? he said. ?Homosexual sodomy? Come on. For 200 years, it was criminal in every state.? [...]
<p>It takes a special kind of man to shrug off challenges to death penalty and abortion restrictions with nary a care in the world about how his interpretations of text might affect real human lives, and to use the phrase ?homosexual sodomy? in 2012. Give him this though: He?s consistent, down to his language. In 2003, when the Supreme Court struck down Texas sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, paving the way for a more widespread dissolution of similar statutes in other states, Scalia wrote the dissenting opinion. At the time, he argued that ?nowhere does the Court?s opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a ?fundamental right,?? adding, ?It is clear from this that <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZD.html"">the Court has taken sides in the culture war</a>, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children?s schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive.?</p>

<p>That dissent from Scalia has been around for a decade, so Brown can hardly claim ignorance of Scalia's extremism. Not just on ""homosexual sodomy"" but also on choice, which Brown continues to insist, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/24/1123699/-Scott-Brown-a-senator-who-votes-prolife"">despite all evidence</a> to the contrary, he supports.</p>
<p>It's about time the traditional media stop asking about Elizabeth Warren's heritage, and start asking about Scott Brown's real ideology.</p>

It's actually past ironic that the man now accusing the Obama White House of cooking today?s unemployment report is the same man who just a few months back complained that the Obama White House is keeping an <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/47035575/Former_GE_CEO_Jack_Welch_Blasts_Obama_s_Leadership"">enemies list</a> that ?would make Richard Nixon proud.?

Hello, human diary. It is I again, Mitt Romney, your better.
<p>These commoners continue to confound me. Of all the things my campaign has focused on over the last few months, now it is firing a large television bird that is gaining the most attention? I have already clearly explained to them that we will need to fire that bird in order to pay for the required tax cuts for job creators, by which I mean myself. If we do not fire large swaths of people, we will not be able to create jobs, and the number of people who will need jobs will be much greater after we have fired them all so it make sense to fire as many of them as possible in order to create those jobs.</p>
<p>Wealthy Americans have no use for improperly tall television birds. I have watched that show before, and found it boring, pedantic and entirely implausible. Why do these obviously lower class residents not simply eat the large bird? Why are unidentifiable creatures allowed to live in garbage cans?is there no law enforcement at all, in America? And C should not be for Cookie. C should be for Capitalism, or perhaps for Credit Default Swaps. At the least we ought to be teaching these irritatingly perky little urchins about proper wealth management techniques.</p>
<p>My apologies, Mr. Diary, I am just reminded of how misguided these commoner units are. In better news, my post-debate experiment in forgoing all sleep continues. So far everything seems to be going smoothly.<br /></p>

Now Mitt Romney has done it. He's <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/mitt-romney-big-bird_n_1940400.html?ref=topbar"">pissed off eight-year-old</a> Alabama resident Cecelia Crawford.<br />
<blockquote>On Thursday morning, she was still angry, so she wrote Romney a letter, sent along to The Huffington Post by her mother. Crawford wrote that she is a fan of ""Sesame Street"" and that it was her ""favorite show on earth"" when she was younger.
<p>""When I grow up I'm going to get married and I want my kids to watch it so do not cut it off,"" Crawford wrote. ""You find something else to cut off!""</p>

I can think of a few things that could be cut off, but how about we start with the Republican House of Representatives that has <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">voted repeatedly</a> to <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/260381-house-moved-to-defund-cpb-in-july-ahead-of-romneys-big-bird-comment"">defund public broadcasting</a>.
<p>They say <a href=""http://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2011/03/house-votes-defund-npr-minnesota-delegation-splits-along-party-lines"">things like this</a>, from Rep. Chip Cravaack:<br /></p>
<blockquote>""It is small, but the small ones add up. A bunch of drops in the bucket fill the pail,"" said Chip Cravaack of cutting NPR's federal dollars out of the entire budget. ""We can't keep on funding programs that are on [our children's] dime, we have to stop. We have to look for savings anywhere we can.""</blockquote>
Nice one there, Chip. Say it's all for the children as you're slashing Sesame Street. They'll sure thank you for that, you heartless bastard. You and every single other Republican our Orange to Blue House candidates are taking on.

Transcript:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Mitt Romney, 10/3/12:</strong> I will not reduce the taxes paid by high income Americans.
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 2/22/12:</strong> There were so many misrepresentations in there it's going to take me a little while. Number one, I said today that we're going to cut taxes on everyone across the country by twenty percent?including the top one percent.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 10/3/12:</strong> The key to great schools? Great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 6/8/12:</strong> He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 10/3/12:</strong> Actually, it's a lengthy description, but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan.</p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney, 3/27/12:</strong> If they're 45 years old and they show up and they say I want insurance because I've got heart disease, it's like: ""Hey guys, we can't play the game like that."" You've got to get insurance when you're well, and then if you get ill, then you're going to be covered.</p>
</blockquote>
The only thing you can trust about Mitt Romney is that he'll say whatever he thinks he needs to say to get what he wants.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">WAKE UP, SHEEPLE</div>
</div>
Come on, SHEEPLE. Please don't tell me you believe any of <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/49305192"">this tripe</a>! Obviously the government is going to lie about a bogus jobs report that the <i>government</i> ginned up!<br />
<blockquote>Given the rush to question the legitimacy of the jobs report, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis felt it necessary to respond to the critics, and appeared on CNBC to say, ""I'm insulted when I hear that, because we have a very professional civil service ... have the highest regard for our professionals that do the calculations at the [Bureau of Labor Statistics]. They are trained economists.""
<p>AOL Jobs spoke today to one of those economists at the BLS, John Mullins, about the process behind putting together the reports.</p>
</blockquote>
Hahah, sure, you mean the process whereby Joe Biden picks up the phone and says, ""Look, Mullins, do you really want to see how long you'll last in a Romney administration? I'm hearing he wants to make Steve King his labor secretary. Not the guy who wrote 'Carrie,' you dope! The fucknut from Iowa!""<br />
<blockquote>Q. How are jobs reports compiled?
<p>A. The data is drawn is from the current population survey and the current employment statistical survey. The first is a survey of households. The second, which I work on, is of business establishments, agencies. And data from both appears in the employment situation report each month, which is where we see the unemployment rate.</p>
</blockquote>
Oh yeah, <i>Demoncrat</i> households, I'll bet?where they've gotten instructions from Obama to lie about their jobs!<br />
<blockquote>Q. What do you ask them?
<p>A. For the current employment survey, we get information on payroll, employment size, hours on the job and total earnings. So it's a sample of stats from businesses that pay unemployment insurance. We ask a subset of that universe to participate.</p>
</blockquote>
Yeah, but do you ask who they're VOTING for? Of course not?why bother? You're only calling Demoncrat homes, anyway!<br />
<blockquote>Q. How is the data delivered?
<p>A. The businesses submit the data in a variety of methods, either electronically or over the phone.</p>
</blockquote>
Like we can trust any of that! Steve Jobs was a Demoncrat, after all! I'm sure he rigged his computers to say whatever his boss, Barry Hussein Soetoro, told him to. I mean, you've seen the new maps on the iPhone 6, right? It's all made up!<br />
<blockquote>Q. So there is human involvement?
<p>A. Yes. And then the data is assessed by a computer program that identifies peculiarities, which we review for accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
Demoncrat humans. Next.<br />
<blockquote>Q. Is there any chance for the data to be doctored?
<p>A. No. And we are not political appointees. In my program, there are 15 economists. I have been here for 15 years, some of my colleagues have been here for longer. We don't really talk politics at work, at least not any more than in any other workplace. I would say I wouldn't even really know which way my colleagues lean politically.</p>
</blockquote>
Why would you need to talk politics when you already know what all your other groupthink hivemind DUMMOCRAT liberal colleagues already think? You all take your orders from Lenin, anyway!<br />
<blockquote>Q. Are there any measures taken to make sure the numbers aren't doctored?
<p>A. The data are reviewed by supervisory staff to make sure the analysis is based on sound statistical data. Any one person doesn't have influence great enough to change the numbers significantly. And over the course of the year, it's cross-checked with state unemployment data, which would reveal any inaccuracies. Our methodology is known to prominent statistical organizations and it is transparent and consistent with standard statistical practices.</p>
<p>The process is open and transparent, and all the information is on our website. Anyone who understands the process and statistics knows how preposterous the charge of doctoring is. And I will add that we're all professionals, and we take pride in this not being political.</p>
</blockquote>
Look, seriously, you guys are protesting too much. We know you make the numbers say whatever you want them to say, and you want them to say whatever's good for Obama and the Demoncrats. But the joke's on you, because you guys are total morons. Why did you wait to start now? You should have been making the numbers look better for the past four years!

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">When is the winner not the winner?</div>
</div>
So how bad has President Barack Obama suffered as a result of his sub-par first debate? The tracking polls are certainly not giving anyone reason to panic. That is, unless you are a Republican:
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
<p>Note that these Ipsos numbers are from their tracking poll, not the <a href=""http://kos.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140220/-Romney-gains-after-debate-with-Republicans-Obama-with-independents"">post-debate poll</a> they ran yesterday showing the race going from Obama 48-39 pre-debate to Obama 48-43 post-debate. Those were one-day samples, not the rolling sample here.</p>
<p>Remember, the Ipsos rolling sample is five days long, Rasmussen's is three days, and Gallup is seven days. So the post-debate sample is just <s>1/5th</s> 2/5th (see update), 1/3rd and 1/7th of those numbers, respectively. But had Obama tanked the day after the debate, there would be some slippage in the tracking poll toplines, not <i>improvement</i> for Obama. So if Romney saw any bump in his Thursday polling, it was offset by even better Obama polling before the debate.</p>
<p>One thing is true?oftentimes it takes several days to a week for a big campaign event to be reflected in the polls, as news junkies disseminate the information at water coolers and backyard picnics across the country. That is particularly the case in tracking polls with rolling samples, so we need to keep watching over the weekend to see if any latent damage starts showing up.</p>
<p>However, Republicans don't seem to be winning the post-debate spin, not when the ""moment"" that came out of the debate wasn't anything Obama said, but the fact that Mitt Romney wants to fire Big Bird.</p>
<p>Indeed, it wasn't the Romney campaign who is turning debate moments into television attack ads and internet memes.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: A new Ipsos/Reuters poll has been released, and I updated the chart above accordingly (the previous one had Obama +1). So Obama has held stead and Romney has gained +3. FYI, the new Ipsos numbers include data collected today, so it now has two days of post-debate responses.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Soon-to-be New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich.</div>
</div>
Here's the latest Senate battleground snapshot, using the <a href=""http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/"">TPM polltracker</a> polling composite:
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
<p><strong>Nebraska</strong> is not included, as Republicans will easily pick up that (vaguely) Democratic seat. The ""Dem"" number above for Maine is actually independent Angus King, since he has become the de facto Democrat in the race.</p>
<p>If the election ended today, and those poll numbers held, Democrats would lose just that Nebraska seat and pick up Arizona, Indiana, Maine, and Massachusetts, for a +3 net gain and a 56-44 Senate. Given that we entered this cycle expecting to barely hold the Senate, that this is a possibility is amazing.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the matter of the undecided voters in these polls, and in Senate races they tend to swing in the direction of the state's dominant political party. That's why I never worried about Elizabeth Warren in <strong>Massachusetts</strong>?as long as she had the resources to compete against Scott Brown, the state's heavily Democratic voters would likely swing in her direction (and they have been). <strong>Maine</strong> is complicated, but still, the only time Republicans win is when the state's significant independent and Democratic wings split the vote evenly. Right now, the Democrat in the race is a sideshow with much of the state's left-of-center support coalescing around King.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong> should technically look good, and it still might, but things are complicated by bullshit ethics issues that have dogged Democrat Shelley Berkley's campaign. She'll outperform the polls on election day because of the Obama machine, but she needs to stay close to appointed Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller. <strong>Connecticut's</strong> liberal leanings will close the deal for our candidate, as should Wisconsin's.</p>
<p>So what about Arizona, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota? Those are all red states in which our candidate is currently leading, but below 50 percent. Yeah, those are the tough ones.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>'s partisan leanings would clearly give Republican Jeff Flake the advantage, yet he's failing to keep pace with the top of his ticket. I still give him the edge, but Richard Carmona is certainly coming on strong and has a legit chance of pulling it off, particularly if Latinos turn out. Heck, some polling is showing the race competitive at the presidential level which would obviously make Cardona's task easier if true.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong> remains the most likely to stay Red in this list. While Democrat Joe Donnelly has a narrow lead, and while Republican Richard Mourdock is embarrassingly below 40 percent, it'll be easier for the Republican to break 50 percent in a state that Obama isn't contesting this year. Still, regardless of how conservative the state might be, Mourdock's anemic numbers show that he's a poor fit for the state. It shouldn't even be competitive, so it's wonderful seeing Republicans dump money into a state that would've been a default hold if the teabaggers hadn't ousted Sen. Dick Lugar in their primary.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong> should be a tough hold in this open-seat race, but Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is hovering just below the 50 percent mark in a state small enough where retail politics matters. And she's good at the retail politics.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Montana</strong> is a real dogfight with two statewide-elected members of Congress?Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and Republican Rep. Danny Rehberg, who represents the state's sole House seat. While Obama isn't contesting the state (he lost it by just 49-47 in 2008), it's more purplish than true Red, and Democrats are competitive at all levels of government. So while Rehberg should get a slight partisan advantage, the fact that he is a well-known <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/02/02/rehberg_montana_senate/"">drunk</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J2JjIPWsx8"">asshole</a> could do him in. Still, expect this to be the last Senate race called on Election Night. Just like in 2006.</p>
<p>If I had to guess today, I'd say the Dems end up losing that single seat in Nebraska, while picking up Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada for a net gain of two seats. But the picture is definitely in flux.</p>
<p>Finally, let's play the ""how many candidates break 45 percent"" game. For Republicans, it's two of 17. For Democrats, it's 12 of 17. Just like Romney, their Senate candidates are finding it really difficult to get out of the mid-40s.</p>
<p>The big mystery: why aren't we seeing similar GOP difficulties in the House? What makes the GOP brand so toxic at the presidential and Senate levels, but not in the battle for the House? Gerrymandering is the obvious answer, but that wouldn't explain the slight Democratic edge in the generic congressional ballot polling. I'm perplexed.</p>

<blockquote>President Obama's campaign set a monthly record for the 2012 cycle in September, hauling in more than $150 million, according to the Wall Street Journal:
<p>The September total far surpasses the $114 million raised in August, when the Obama team snapped a three-month streak in which it was outraised by Republican challenger Mitt Romney. At the time, the $114 million was the most the Obama campaign had collected in any one month in the 2012 election season. The most the Romney campaign has collected so far was $111 million in August.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Just because it's <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/ron-paul-suggests-hell-vote-for-gary-johnson"">funny</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In a Fox Business interview Wednesday, Rep. Ron Paul refused to say who he was planning on voting for ? but ruled out voting for Mitt Romney or President Obama, leaving only one plausible option.
<p>""I obviously haven't announced in support for Romney, so that means that's very unlikely,"" Paul said. ""And I don't think anybody think's I'm going to vote for Obama. So it's back to that frustration level in not seeing a dramatic choice in how the system works.""</p>

<blockquote>Jim Lehrer has been widely criticized for his passive performance as the moderator of Wednesday?s night?s presidential debate, but in his first post-debate interview, he tells POLITICO that he was simply fulfilling his new mission, which was to allow the candidates to engage one another without interruption.
<p>?Based on what the goal was, I saw it as successful,? Lehrer told POLITICO. ?I?ve always said this and finally I had a chance to demonstrate it: The moderator should be seen little and heard even less. It is up to the candidates to ask the follow-up questions and challenge one another.?</p>
<p>?I don?t consider that being passive, I consider it being effective,? he said.</p>

<li>CNN's Anderson Cooper had a <a href=""http://gay.americablog.com/2012/10/anderson-cooper-blasts-star-jones-for-criticizing-his-coming-out.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Americablog+%28AMERICAblog+News%29"">few words</a> for Star Jones' reaction to him coming out:<br />
<blockquote>Star Jones, of all people. I mean, I haven?t thought about Star Jones in I don?t know how long, I was unaware she was even on TV still. But she apparently shows up on a morning show? and all of a sudden out of the blue, Star Jones said after I sent this email [coming out], Star Jones said that this was a ratings ploy by me to boost ratings.
<p>That?s why it?s so annoying. Of all the ways to boost ratings, like, if I was wanting to boost ratings, I?d have waited to announce it on a ?very special episode,? that would have been promo?d for weeks and weeks, and there would have been commercials, ?Andersons HUGE announcement!?, and you would have a cutaway of the audience going ?oh!? [covers his mouth in shock].</p>
<p>But instead, I was in Africa on an assignment for 60 Minutes. I sent an email to a friend of mine who put it on a Web site. I gave no interviews about it. I never talked about it. I wasn?t even on the air for days afterward.</p>

<blockquote>A pornographic website that said it launched a fundraising effort for and was adamantly rejected by Susan G. Komen for the Cure still wants to raise money for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
<p>The porn site said in a press release that it is now looking for a new charity for its ?Save the Boobs? campaign throughout October. [...]</p>

Then he changed his mind while his top aides polled 'all-white and race-conscious' Michigan communities for a 'secret' white backlash vote against LBJ's civil rights advances -- a backlash that might have made a Goldwater endorsement palatable at home.

<blockquote><p>On Sunday morning?s Meet The Press, legendary newsman Tom Brokaw joined moderator David Gregory in evening out the ?specifics? narrative that has dogged Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney by demanding that President Obama give more details about his plan to control the deficit and debt. Brokaw said that in a 2008 debate, then-Senator Obama ?was saying, ?Look, we?ve got a deficit of a half a trillion dollars. I?m going to get that under control.? Well, this week that deficit is $1.1 trillion and it happened on his watch. He?s going to have to answer to that.?</p>
<p>By the time President Obama took office, however, he was <a href=""http://home.adelphi.edu/sbloch/deficits.html"">handed a $1.017 trillion deficit</a> by President <strong>George W. Bush</strong>. [...]</p>
<p>The<a href=""http://home.adelphi.edu/sbloch/deficits.html""> half-trillion dollar deficit</a> that President Obama was referring to, however, was for the fiscal year  ending in September of 2007. The deficit for FY 2008 was $1,017,071.  That still leaves President Obama?s promise to ?get that under control?  arguably unfulfilled, but also dramatically alters the terrain of that  argument.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would add to that, what Brokaw is also completely ignoring is just whose policies have added to the deficit, and as this chart displays, you can place the bulk of that squarely in Bush's lap as well -- <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/adding-to-the-deficit-bush-vs-obama/2012/01/31/gIQAQ0kFgQ_graphic.html"" title="" Bush vs. Obama"">Adding to the deficit: Bush vs. Obama</a>.</p>

We have got to in these final few weeks, try to reach some resolution about this revenue issue whether we raise revenue to deal with the debt because whether it?s Medicare or whether it?s dealing with the debt level at the level that it?s at, without agreement on both sides, we?re not going to be able to tackle some of these more difficult issues, Tom.</p>
<p>MR. BROKAW:  You know, I think that both campaigns have failed to say to the American public this is going to be hard.  This is a real crisis in America.  You look at the IMF projections about where the global economy is now.  They?re saying you got to get your act together.  We could be in another recession next year at this time.  They?ve got to level with the American people about everyone?s going to have to give something.  And there is going to have to be some revenue raised at some point as well.  I do think that the governor is right and we?ll expect to hear Governor Romney go after President Obama this time about I want more details about your plan.  You keep harping on me.  I haven?t heard the details in your plan as well.  I looked at that debate that we talked about a moment ago, it was playing last night on C-SPAN, and governor, now President-- now President Obama was saying look, we?ve got a deficit of half a trillion dollars.

<p>Tomorrow North Carolina state Rep. Patsy Keever will be back here for a live chat at Crooks and Liars. That video above is a TV ad-- except it's not on TV. Patsy, one of the most consistently independent and progressive voices in the North Carolina legislature, is running for Congress in the newly redrawn 10th district. Her opponent is Wall Street shill Patrick McHenry and he's taken in well over a million dollars. Of that money, 54% was from PACs, 44% was from large donors and only 2% came from small grassroots contributions. He sits on the House Financial Services Committee, so it may offend you, but shouldn't surprise you to know that he gets most of his money from special interests with business before his committee.</p>
<p>His half dozen single biggest contributors were Wells Fargo, sleazy payday lenders Advance America Cash Advance Centers, American Bankers Association, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, and Moneytree, Inc. These are all interests who count on McHenry to screw over his own constituents on behalf on predator banksters. They have financed his career and he has stabbed his own neighbors in the backs on their account. Up against his million dollars-plus, Patsy's grassroots campaign has raised $482,279.15. She doesn't have the money she needs to put that ad up on TV and she's going to be pushing it online. Blue America wants her to get it up on television in the 10th district.</p>
<p>Although cable TV is a lot less expensive and we can probably help her get the ad on Anderson Cooper's show in Gastonia, Rachel Maddow's in Asheville and <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> in Hickory, broadcast TV in Patsy's part of North Carolina costs $322 per point. You have to buy 100 points at a time, and 100 points will guarantee that your ad will be seen once by your target audience in the space of a week. So we can say we want to target high-information voters... then 100 points will get us one ad seen by high information voters (during the news) in the space of a week. <a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/page/patsy"">Would you like to help us try?</a></p>
<p>Like I said, tomorrow afternoon (2pm, EST), Patsy, who we haven't talked with since she beat her ConservaDem opponent in the primary, will be joining us for a live chat. She's been focused like a laser on making sure folks in western North Carolina know just who Patrick McHenry is and that ""he voted to allow taxpayer money to be spent on companies that have outsourced our jobs to China, India and Mexico. I will vote,"" she told voters, ""to support companies that keep our jobs right here in America.""</p>
<p>Here's <a href=""https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/patsy"">the page where you can watch the ad and contribute to Patsy's campaign</a> at the same time. Do you have any friends you could send the link to?</p>

</p>
<p>So now the previously well-behaved and compliant Portugese are protesting in the streets over their <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/europe/portugal-readies-budget-with-job-cuts-and-tax-increases.html?pagewanted=all"">government's austerity plans:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The turning point came in September when Mr. Passos Coelho offered <strong>a plan to redistribute social security funds by cutting employers? social security taxes while significantly raising those of employees. Although the measure was meant to lower labor costs, the outcry from workers was so ferocious that he was soon forced to withdraw it.</strong></p>
<p>But the damage was already done. The misstep is now credited with having rattled the social and political cohesion that had underpinned Portugal?s painful but steady progress.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the tax plan left the Portuguese, who had once grudgingly accepted the pain of austerity, with a new sense of empowerment, Mr. Magalhães said. <strong>?The fact that the government backed down and the fact that no catastrophe or international censure came out of it suddenly shows that there are no inevitabilities,? he said.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Pay attention, will you, people? We may need this sooner than you think.</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] Mr. Vieira Lopes suggested that the fundamental problem was that the bailout assistance program from Portugal?s international lenders did not take sufficiently into account the specifics of the nation.</p>
<p>?The austerity model has been applied rather mechanically,? he said. ?This is not a country full of big companies that can adjust to a decline in their domestic market, but rather small and medium-sized companies whose only option is then to close down.?</p>
<p>Many stores in downtown Lisbon are now either closed or advertising huge discounts, as citizens struggle in a deepening recession that has pushed unemployment to a record 15 percent. A sharp rise in the sales tax has decimated the restaurant sector. One measure of the hardship has been the sudden proliferation of the ?marmita,? or lunch box, used by employees to take their home cooking to work. Even the investment banking division of Banco Espirito Santo, one of Portugal?s largest financial institutions, recently refitted a room with tables, refrigerators and microwaves to accommodate the trend.</p>
<p>As consumer spending is declining, so too are tax revenues.<strong> As part of its 2012 budget, the government anticipated that sales taxes would produce revenues 11.6 percent higher than in 2011. Instead, revenues were down 2.2 percent in the first eight months of this year</strong>, as the tax increases suffocate the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine. Apparently leaving people without any money to spend depresses tax revenues and <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/13/imf-george-osborne-austerity-76bn?CMP=twt_gu"">contracts the economy</a>! Who would have guessed?</p>

<p>We'll never hear that on Fox though, where they've decided they're going to ride this horse right through to the election, hoping it helps them get Mitt Romney elected.</p>
<blockquote><p>WALLACE: Laura?</p>
<p>INGRAHAM: Well, I think about Susan Rice going out there on this show and four other shows on Sunday, and I'd like to know did Susan Rice have any direct or indirect contact with anyone from the Obama campaign, David Axelrod, Plouffe, maybe Valerie Jarrett? She still works in the White House, but obviously very close to the president.</p>
<p>HUME: Tom Donilon.</p>
<p>INGRAHAM: Yeah, Tom Donilon. I would like to know that. I'd like Mr. Axelrod to answer that question.</p>
<p>I would hope that the New York Times, as they camped outside of Scooter Libby's house during the whole Valerie Plame thing, are they -- are you guys camped outside of the Susan Rice residence?</p>

<p>WOODWARD: It's great...</p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p>WOODWARD: ... another assignment...</p>
<p>(CROSSTALK)    </p>
<p>INGRAHAM: No, but this is -- we have a dead ambassador, two Navy SEALs, dead, another security officer dead. The president answers this the next morning by flying to Vegas for a fund-raiser. If I -- I submit that if this were a Republican president and this went down this way, you'd have reporters camped outside of Hillary's house, Rice's house, and demand that the president do a full-blown press conference on what happened. Maybe it is just incompetence, maybe it's a series of innocent mistakes, but my goodness, when you had three attacks, violent attacks inside Benghazi, on the Red Cross office, the consulate and then postings on Facebook we're coming after you on September 10th, they didn't have any actionable intelligence? What? I mean, this is ridiculous. And I think the press is partly culpable here.</p></blockquote>

<p>The last thing the right wing wants anyone to hear is that things really are better today than they were four years ago, even if it's the truth. This is why they, with <em>Mediaite's</em> cooperation, managed to create a firestorm of nonsense over an out-of-context statement Michelle Obama made during a radio interview today. You can hear the full exchange at about the 6:00 minute mark. </p>
<p>Here, for your edification, is what she said:</p>
<blockquote><p>MRS. OBAMA:  Well, and it?s also because people are listening.  They?re starting to see -- really see up close the differences. <strong> I mean, we?re seeing right now that we?re in the midst of a huge recovery, right, because of what this President has done -- pulled this economy from the brink of collapse</strong>, where we were losing 800,000 jobs a month; now we?re gaining every -- throughout most of his presidency we?ve been adding jobs to this economy because of what he?s been doing.  The stock market has doubled.  Housing prices are rising.  Foreclosure rates are lowering. </p>
<p>But in the face of that, you still have people trying to convince us that things aren?t better, and that just doesn?t make sense. <strong> Now, Barack of all people, knows that we still have a long way to go to completely rebuild the economy, but we?re headed in the right direction.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Do you see Michelle Obama saying that everything is coming up roses and our unicorns will be passed out on November 7th? No? Me either. </p>
<p>But Mediaite tossed her reference to a <a href=""http://www.mediaite.com/online/michelle-obama-%E2%80%98we-are-in-the-midst-of-a-huge-recovery%E2%80%99/"">""huge recovery"" into their headline</a>, and <a href=""http://nation.foxnews.com/michelle-obama/2012/10/15/michelle-obama-we-are-midst-huge-recovery"">away Fox Nation went</a>, along with <a href=""http://cnsnews.com/news/article/michelle-obama-we-are-midst-huge-recovery"">CNS News</a> and TownHall.com. All of the wingers were quick to pull out their handy statistics and quote statistics to ridicule her and basically say she was full of it, flooding Twitter and Facebook with their <a href=""http://www.memeorandum.com/121015/p53#a121015p53"">phony meme</a> intended to try and say she was lying. </p>
<p>Memo to winger meme-makers: She actually has to say it in context, you know? Like Eric Fehrnstrom did with the ""Etch-a-Sketch"" remark. No one took him out of context, but you seem to love to take others out of context.</p>
<p>Strangely absent: any acknowledgment that any slowdown they might like to claim can be laid at the doorstep of the Congress, who has steadfastly refused to do anything but pass a lot of bills telling women they're second-class citizens without any right to control their own bodies.</p>
<p>Worse, they completely ignored context. As I said, it wasn't as though the unicorns were singing in the background as she spoke. Yet they ignorde the part where she very clearly states that the president is keenly aware that there is much more work to do, because you know, they couldn't ridicule her if they actually paid attention to the barest contextual frames. </p>
<p>They do this constantly, and they do it for a couple of reasons. First, because it gives Fox &amp; Friends a great opportunity to ridicule her on the air. Count on that tomorrow morning. It becomes the theme of the day, and what a terrific theme just ahead of the next presidential debate. The other reason they do it is to work the refs, in order to shame media outlets into ignoring the recovery altogether if they possibly can.</p>
<p>That second reason is the one more insidious than the first, and the media so far has complied. Imagine that a Republican had pulled the country back from the brink of another Great Depression. I know, it's a stretch, but just try for a minute. Don't you think Fox News would have us thinking it was as though Jesus himself had walked on the troubled waters of our economy to bring us a Republican savior who not only should be re-elected, but should be deified? </p>
<p>Of course they would. But the guy who did it and turned the ship of economic ruin around wasn't a Republican, nor did was the Recovery Act supported by Republicans. So they've boxed themselves into having to sell the falsehood that the stimulus didn't work and nothing is better now than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>My 401k plan, what's left of it after the Great Healthcare Raid of 2009, thinks we're better off. In this month of 2012, my spouse is employed and we're not relying on unemployment benefits like we did in 2008. Many, many people I know can make similar claims. </p>
<p>Does that mean it's done? No. I know others who haven't recovered, and who are just now beginning to see signs of hope. Just like the First Lady said, recovery has been happening, but there is a long way to go.</p>
<p>I dare Fox News to admit that. And <em>Mediaite</em>, who thought they should put an out-of-context quote in their headline without highlighting the offsetting disclaimer; that is, there's still a long way to go.</p>
<p>Next time, I hope the First Lady just comes out and says she thinks it would have been a huge recovery if Republicans hadn't decided the uterus was stronger than the job market.</p>

<p>?Hello everybody, hello!? the president said, according to pool reports, <strong>as he walked in the door with pizzas in hand. ?I brought some food.?</strong></p>

<p>The president called volunteer Griselda Bayton, who has been working for his campaign.</p>
<p>?I wanted to call and say thank you,? he said.</p>
<p>Next, he called Ellen Hawkins, who seemed a bit shocked when she picked up the phone.</p>
<p>?Is this Ellen?? Obama asked. <strong>?Ellen, this is Barack Obama. It is. Really, truly.?</strong></p>
<p>Asked by a reporter how debate prep is going, the president replied simply, ?It is going great!?</p></blockquote>

<p>Many of us have been blasting the politics of austerity because there has never been one fact to support it especially during an economic crisis, but England's grand poobah has been leading the austerity charge and hasn't backed down. The IMF is <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/13/imf-george-osborne-austerity-76bn"">just the latest organization to throw could water on his predictions</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"" title=""More from guardian.co.uk on George Osborne""><strong>George Osborne</strong></a>'s drastic deficit-cutting programme will have sucked £76bn more out of  the economy than he expected by 2015, according to estimates from the  International Monetary Fund of the price of austerity.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christine-lagarde"" title=""More from guardian.co.uk on Christine Lagarde"">Christine Lagarde</a>,  the IMF's managing director, last week caused consternation among  governments that have embarked on controversial spending cuts by arguing  that the impact on economic growth may be greater than previously  thought.</p>
<p>The independent Office for Budget Responsibility  implicitly used a ""fiscal multiplier"" of 0.5 to estimate the impact of  the coalition's tax rises and spending cuts on the economy. That meant  each pound of cuts was expected to reduce economic output by 50p.  However, after examining the records of many countries that have  embraced austerity since the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"" title=""More from guardian.co.uk on Financial crisis"">financial crisis</a>, the IMF reckons the true multiplier is 0.9-1.7.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow, who could have predicted that? Well, everybody who isn't a conservative. </p>
<blockquote><p>Neal Lawson, director of left-wing pressure group Compass, said, ""the cuts were never going to work, but these calculations show the effect  is bigger than anyone judged. The economy isn't suffering from <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/government-borrowing"" title=""More from guardian.co.uk on Government borrowing"">government borrowing</a> but a severe lack of demand that only the government can fix.""</p>
<p>Osborne  told reporters in Tokyo that the IMF does not allow for the boost  provided to growth by the Bank of England's £375bn of quantitative  easing. ""The point I would make about their study of the fiscal  multipliers is that they explicitly say they were not taking into  account offsetting monetary policy action. In the UK, I would argue we  have a tough and credible fiscal policy to allow for loose and  accommodative monetary policy and I think that is the right  combination.""</p>
<p><strong>But  many economists believe the dent in growth  caused by austerity policies may be larger than first thought, because  the financial crisis has left banks starving  firms and households of  credit; and with many countries cutting back simultaneously, it is  harder to fill the gap created by cuts with demand for exports</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier this month Former, GE CEO Jack Welch spawned a ?jobs truthers? front after he <a href=""http://twitter.com/jack_welch/statuses/254198154260525057"">tweeted</a> that an unemployment rate of 7.8 percent was ?unbelievable,? and added that the ?Chicago guys? in Obama?s campaign headquarters ?will do anything..can?t debate so change numbers.?</p>
<p>Trump told the hosts of <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> on Monday that Welch got it right.</p>
<p>""They're not real numbers because the 7.8 [percent] -- as Jack Welch said and he took a lot of heat for saying it, but he's right -- I guarantee you're going to have a correction right after the election,"" the billionaire reality star explained. ""The 7.8 is not a real number. The real number is 15 percent, 16 percent, people even say 21 percent.""</p>
<p>""So, it's a phony number,"" he added. ""I don't know how they allow it to get out there, but I guarantee you, as you're sitting there after the election, that number is going to be corrected substantially upward. And everybody knows it.""</p>
<p>Trump also had some advice for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney prior to Tuesday night's second debate with Obama. </p>
<p>""I don't think he has to prepare too much,"" Trump explained. ""He's a smart guy. He's a good leader. He has it. He gets it for this country. He really gets it. And I will say this, if Obama has a performance like he had a couple of weeks ago, I don't believe it's possible for him to win the election.""</p>
<p>""Who knows? Did he become more intelligent in the last two weeks? You tell me.""</p>

<p>Indeed, Clinton made the statement in direct reference to whether Barack Obama would be an effective president. (At the time, she said he wouldn't be an effective president.) As the <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-barack-obama-leader-article-1.346103"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>New York Daily News</em> reported at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama: You don't get what it takes to be an effective President. ? The nation's faltering economy was the backdrop yesterday in the Democrats' clash over what the presidency entails. ""I know that we can get on top of this, but it's going to require strong presidential leadership - it's going to require a President who knows from day one you have to run a government and manage the economy,"" she said. ""The buck stops in the Oval Office.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That attack, carried out by al Qaeda, left four Americans dead, including the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens.</p>
<p>Over a month after the 9/11 attack, the facts of what happened--when, where, and how--are still not yet entirely clear.</p>"

<p>In response, three Republican senators--John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte--are insisting that the buck must stop instead with the president of the United States, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>""We have just learned that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has claimed full responsibility for any failure to secure our people and our Consulate in Benghazi prior to the attack of September 11, 2012. This is a laudable gesture, especially when the White House is trying to avoid any responsibility whatsoever,"" the senators say in a joint statement.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">""However, we must remember that the events of September 11 were preceded by an escalating pattern of attacks this year in Benghazi, including a bomb that was thrown into our Consulate in April, another explosive device that was detonated outside of our Consulate in June, and an assassination attempt on the British Ambassador. If the President was truly not aware of this rising threat level in Benghazi, then we have lost confidence in his national security team, whose responsibility it is to keep the President informed. But if the President was aware of these earlier attacks in Benghazi prior to the events of September 11, 2012, then he bears full responsibility for any security failures that occurred. <strong>The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the Commander-in-Chief. The buck stops there</strong>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Furthermore, there is the separate issue of the insistence by members of the Administration, including the President himself, that the attack in Benghazi was the result of a spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video, long after it had become clear that the real cause was a terrorist attack. The President also bears responsibility for this portrayal of the attack, and we continue to believe that the American people deserve to know why the Administration acted as it did.""</p>"

<blockquote><p>On Rice ?grew out of a protest? assertions: ?the fog of war. The confusion you get in any type of combat situation. Remember this was an attack that went on for hours?there had to be a lot of sorting out?everyone said here?s what we know subject to change.?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clinton's excuse for Rice is because the U.N. ambassador went on five Sunday talk shows and said in several different ways that the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya ""grew out of a protest"" outside the American consulate there.</p>
<p>That is not at all what happened. Apparently the fog of war was too thick for Rice to accurately say what happened there. In fact, the State Department now says there was no protest at all outside the consulate there.</p>
<p>Instead, the attack that killed the American ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans was the direct result of a planned and coordinated al Qaeda terrorist attack that was aimed at coinciding with the anniversary of the greatest al Qaeda attack again America in history, 9/11.</p>

<p>The attack took place five days before Rice went on those shows and made those false assertions. But only now is the fog beginning to clear.</p>

<blockquote><p>Six-in-ten voters say they watched at least a little of last Thursday night?s vice-presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan at Centre College in Danville, KY. Among debate watchers, as many say Biden did the better job (47%) as say Ryan (46%)....</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Republican voters overwhelmingly say Ryan did the better job in the debate (88%); a comparable percentage of Democrats (89%) say Biden did the better job. <strong>Among independents, 50% say Ryan did better, 39% say Biden</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pew poll's finding of a tie at the VP debate is consistent with other surveys: A CNN flash poll the night of the debate showed <a href=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/11/cnn-poll-on-debate-winner-ryan-48-biden-44/"" rel=""nofollow"">Ryan beating Biden 48 percent to 44 percent</a> among registered voters, and a <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/12/us-usa-campaign-debate-poll-idUSBRE89B1AK20121012"" rel=""nofollow"">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> showed Biden beating Ryan 42 percent to 35 percent among registered voters.
</p><p>A few conservatives who have watched <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPxMZ1WdINs"" rel=""nofollow"">Ryan wipe the floor with Obama</a> seem to have been a little disappointed he didn't score an overwhelming victory against Biden last Thursday night. But given the circumstances, it's hard to see what Ryan could have done to trounce Biden. Ryan tends to speak in paragraphs, not soundbites, and <a href=""http://weaselzippers.us/2012/10/13/video-all-85-joe-biden-interruptions/"" rel=""nofollow"">Biden's constant interruptions</a> made it difficult for viewers to follow all of Ryan's points. And the moderator, a foreign correspondent for ABC News, did not to ask a single question specifically about the debt or Obamacare (Ryan's strongest issues). Despite these challenges, Ryan still won the debate in the minds of independent voters, according to Pew.</p>"

That pattern was identified in an influential essay, &ldquo;The Problem of American Conservatism,&rdquo; published by the historian Alan Brinkley in 1994. Brinkley was writing two years after the religious right of Pat Robertson had stunned liberals by hijacking the GOP convention from the country-club patrician George H.W. Bush&mdash;the same fundamentalist right that had ostensibly retreated from politics after the humiliating Scopes trial in the twenties.</p><p><a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/330466/view-bridge-michael-walsh"">Keep reading this post</a> . . .</p>"

Wade","7","-3","0","","2012-10-16 16:39:30","<p>Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle covered up Mitt Romney's extreme position on reproductive rights, claiming that Romney ""didn't say that he was going to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a legal right to abortion. But Romney has clearly articulated his desire that the ruling be overturned.</p>
<p>On October 15, Fox News' <em>The Five</em> played an <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57532758/celebrities-blast-romney-on-womens-health/"">ad</a> from MoveOn.org critical of Romney's positions on women's health. Commenting on the ad, Guilfoyle said, ""Mitt Romney didn't say that he was going to overturn Roe v. Wade. That's an absolute falsehood.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fox's attempt to conceal Romney's extreme stance on reproductive rights echoes Romney's efforts to moderate his position on abortion. In a recent interview with&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Des Moines Register</em>'s editorial board, Romney&nbsp;<a href=""http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda/article?nclick_check=1"">said</a>: ""There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda.""</p>
<p>But the fact is that Romney has clearly outlined his support for overturning Roe v. Wade, which he has&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/newly-moderate-mitt-romney-says-he-wont-pursue-abortion-laws/57792/"">called</a>&nbsp;""one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history."" According to his&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mittromney.com/issues/values"">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mitt believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade -- a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate.</p>

<p>According to Fox News host Greta Van Susteren's <a href=""http://gretawire.foxnewsinsider.com/2012/10/15/fncs-wendell-goler-just-interviewed-secretary-of-state-hillary-clinton-see-what-secretary-clinton-says-about-ambassador-susan-rice-fog-of-war-click-to-read-red-text/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+foxnewsinsider/gretawire+(Gretawire"">blog</a>, Fox News reporter Wendell Goler spoke with Secretary Clinton in Peru today<em>.</em> Ingraham tweeted a link to notes on the interview and misrepresented them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ingraham conflated two responses that Secretary Clinton gave during the interview to imply that Clinton couldn't ""speak to who knew what"" regarding the September 11 Benghazi attack. In fact, Clinton's comments were about a separate IED attack in Benghazi in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ingraham <a href=""https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/257999622935556096"">tweeted</a>, ""Hillary tries to defuse the Benghazi issue bef the debate--says she's responsible but 'can't speak to who knew what.' ""</p>

<p>Goler's notes from the interview include Clinton saying she is ""responsible for the State Dept, for the more than 60K people around the world,"" and that ""decisions about security are made by security professionals."" Goler's notes then say that Clinton responded to a question regarding a separate June IED attack:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Re June IED attack: ""I can't speak to who knew what. We knew there were security breaches and problems throughout Libya. That's something that came about as the aftermath of the revolution to topple Ghadaffy with so many militias formed. So many weapons loose...it was taken into account by security professionals as they made their assessments.""&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Associated Press <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-wrestles-with-how-where-to-strike-back-if-libya-consulate-attackers-can-be-found/2012/10/15/c6529b80-16ee-11e2-a346-f24efc680b8d_print.html"">reported</a> today that the ""White House has put special operations strike forces on standby and moved drones into the skies above Africa, ready to strike militant targets from Libya to Mali -- if investigators can find the al-Qaida-linked group responsible for the death of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans in Libya.""</p>
<p>The article, which noted that ""[f]inding the militants who overwhelmed a small security force at the consulate isn't going to be easy,"" stated that members of the Libyan militia group Ansar al-Shariah are key suspects but that ""U.S. investigators have only loosely linked 'one or two names' to the attack, and they lack proof that it was planned ahead of time, or that the local fighters had any help from the larger al-Qaida affiliate.""</p>
<p>But on Fox News' <em>The Five</em>, the co-hosts largely glossed over these details to claim that this ""was too little far too late"" and showed ""an inept foreign policy"" on the part of the Obama administration, as Kimberly Guilfoyle put it. Greg Gutfeld argued that the administration's possible strike ""is exploitative and political"" because it was announced ""the day before a debate.""</p>

However, the <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser"">video</a> released by <em>Mother Jones</em> last month shows Romney attacking supporters of President Obama as ""dependent on government"" and unwilling to ""take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""</p>
<p>While giving advice to Romney about tomorrow's presidential debate, Limbaugh said Romney ""accurately"" pointed out that 47 percent of the voting public will support Obama ""no matter what."" Limbaugh claimed the 47 percent ""are your average Democratic voters"" but ""it doesn't mean [Romney] is not going to represent them."" Limbaugh also claimed Obama, not Romney, has ""written off a whole class of Americans.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>Limbaugh then went on to spin Romney's comments as a ""statistical fact"" and called his statement a ""throwaway comment.""&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Romney's remarks were more than just a ""statistical fact"" about ""your average Democratic voter."" Romney disparaged Obama supporters overall, describing them as people ""who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims."" Romney concluded by saying ""I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""</p><div class=""feedflare"">

Joe Wilson to attack the Obama campaign for calling out dishonest claims by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, contrasting the campaign's treatment of Romney with the backlash Wilson received following his infamous ""you lie"" outburst in 2009. But not once during the interview did Kelly try to ascertain whether the Obama campaign's assertions about Romney were true -- or examine Wilson's 2009 accusation that President Obama was lying.</p>
<p>In fact, many of Romney's claims during the October 3 debate were indeed false -- just as Wilson's charge was, as well.</p>
<p>On today's <em>America Live</em>, Kelly suggested that Obama and his team were ""applying a different standard"" to Romney than ""they demanded"" of Wilson and that ""this liar, liar, liar theme"" was working in part because their accusations weren't made on the floor of the House. She went on to suggest that there is a ""double standard"" in the way Obama wants to be treated and the way his team treats others.</p>
<p>Wilson agreed, dismissing his 2009 outburst as ""spontaneous"" and an example of him being ""passionate about issues."" He went on to say that he later apologized for ""interrupting."" Kelly simply referred to his accusation as a ""breach of decorum.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>In September 2009, during Obama's health care address to a joint session of Congress, Wilson <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2009-09-10/politics/obama.heckled.speech_1_illegal-immigrants-illegal-aliens-rep-joe-wilson?_s=PM:POLITICS"">shouted</a> ""you lie"" after Obama stated that it's false to claim that health care reform would insure undocumented immigrants. As PolitiFact <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/joe-wilson/joe-wilson-south-carolina-said-obama-lied-he-didnt/"">noted</a>, Wilson's statement was false.&nbsp;</p><div class=""feedflare"">

Despite those tragic attacks and the roughly 30,000 deaths by firearms that occur every year,&nbsp;moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS' <em>NewsHour</em> failed to ask the presidential candidates about gun violence during the first presidential debate, the only forum specifically dedicated to domestic policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>14 mass shootings have been committed over the past four years, <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map?page=2"">according to an analysis</a> by <em>Mother Jones</em>. These include recent tragedies that rocked the American public this year, such as the attack at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and an assault at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Last year, a mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, nearly claimed the life of then-U.S. representative Gabrielle Giffords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in the first presidential debate for the 2012 election, Lehrer asked no questions on the topic of gun violence. This continues the troubling pattern established during the 2008 presidential debates, which similarly featured no discussion of the topic even in the wake of the mass shooting at Virginia Tech the previous year.&nbsp;Past presidential debates have featured this subject regularly: A <em>Media Matters</em> review found that in 1992, the second debate spent over six minutes on it; in 1996, the first debate gave it almost four minutes; in 2000, the second and third debates devoted more than 13 minutes combined; and in 2004, the third debate spent nearly three minutes on it.</p>

<p>Breitbart.com columnist William Bigelow <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/15/Cleveland-Plain-Dealer-vote?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BreitbartFeed+(Breitbart+Feed)"">responded</a> that by taking this stance, the <em>Plain Dealer</em> ""is now tacitly encouraging voters to commit voter fraud.""</p>
<p>But the <em>Plain Dealer</em> has the facts on its side.</p>
<p>Conservatives have used such signs as part of past campaigns to intimidate minority voters. In 1981, the Republican National Committee hung similar posters and took other steps to suppress minority voters, but later <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7422-2004Oct28.html"">agreed</a> to stop such tactics after the Democratic National Committee filed a lawsuit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Courts in the past found that Republicans used tactics that were aimed at intimidating minority voters and suppressing their votes. The consent decrees in New Jersey stemmed from several incidents in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In 1981, the Republican National Committee sent letters to predominantly black neighborhoods in New Jersey, and when 45,000 letters were returned as undeliverable, the committee compiled a challenge list to remove those voters from the rolls. The RNC sent off-duty law enforcement officials to the polls and hung posters in heavily black neighborhoods warning that violating election laws is a crime.</p>

But the agency that released the data explained that the tabloid report is ""misleading"" because it is based on a short-term period that obscures the long-term upward trend in global temperatures.</em></p><h2><strong>Fox And Other Conservative Media Pick Up Tabloid Story To Claim ""Global Warming [Is] Over""</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Daily Mail: ""Global Warming Stopped 16 Years Ago, Reveals Met Office Report Quietly Released.""</strong>&nbsp;In the Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail reporter David Rose wrote that ""new data"" released by the Met Office, the UK's National Weather Service, reveal that ""the world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago,"" because there was ""no discernable rise in aggregate global temperatures."" The Daily Mail and its Sunday sister paper the Mail on Sunday are British tabloids that have repeatedly misrepresented climate science. [Daily Mail,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html"">10/13/12</a>] [<em>Media Matters</em>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/02/01/conservative-media-repeat-tabloids-climate-misi/184390"">The other main datasets which use surface temperature measurements (held by NASA and the NCDC)</a>&nbsp;show greater temperature rise over the last ten years.</p>
<p>The difference may be because the Met Office leaves areas of the Arctic ocean out of their calculations, whilst the other two datasets do not. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.agci.org/docs/2010_Hansen.pdf"">rate of Arctic sea ice loss</a>&nbsp;indicates that the Arctic climate is changing rapidly, and would support suggestions that the Met Office method may underestimate temperature rise in the Arctic. Climate skeptics usually ignore the data from the other datasets. [The Carbon Brief, accessed&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.carbonbrief.org/profiles/has-global-warming-stopped"">10/15/12</a>]</p>

<p><em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> host Steve Doocy criticized the <em>Times</em> for not publishing a story about the <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/09/will-the-media-help-romney-surrogate-catapult-b/190480"">bogus</a> hearing regarding the right-wing <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/10/right-wing-medias-libya-consulate-security-myth/190508"">consulate security myth</a> on today's front-page. According to Doocy, the <em>Times</em> decided an article about ""women in North Korea getting shorter skirts"" was more important than an article about a right-wing conspiracy theory. Doocy's criticism comes several days after the public editor of the <em>Times</em> <a href=""http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/why-wasnt-libya-hearing-on-page-a1-of-the-times/#more-2544"">called out</a> the paper for not publishing a front-page story about the hearing the day after it happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> -- owned by Fox News' parent company, News Corp. -- and the <em>Washington Post </em>did not place stories about the week-old, GOP-led hearing on page one either. In fact, today's page one of the <em>Journal </em>included a story about <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443890304578010264156073132.html?mod=ITP_pageone_0"">the connection between hospital payments and patient happiness</a>.</p>
<p>Today's <em>Times</em> front-page <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/asia/north-koreans-say-life-has-not-improved.html?hp&amp;_r=0&amp;gwh=EEFB03F27980E4793FDF2AB2751A007C"">article</a> discussed the plight of the average North Korean under the country's new leader Kim Jong Un, a story that contrary to Doocy's claim, is about more than just mini-skirts.&nbsp;North Koreans interviewed for the story said ""their lives have gotten harder, despite Mr. Kim's tantalizing pronouncements about boosting people's livelihoods that have fueled outside hopes that the nuclear-armed nation might ease its economically ruinous obsession with military hardware and dabble in Chinese-style market reforms.""</p>
<p>As noted by the <em>Times</em>, these individuals took a risk by talking to the media because ""the gulag awaits those who speak to journalists or Christian missionaries."" Apparently, their courage means little to Fox's definition of ""newsworthy.""</p><div class=""feedflare"">

The thought crossed my mind that the whole thing was a sneaky way of making Romney look bad. But even if Hannity?s praise of O'Donnell didn't seem quite sincere, he sure did a good job of looking like his good wishes for her and Romney were...."

<blockquote>
<p>It's a bit rich for all these people to suddenly be arguing that Libya is the most important story in the world after ignoring it for months. It reeks of political opportunism. Did Darrell Issa show any sign that he cared one iota about Libya before the morning of Sept. 12, 2012? Did Mitt Romney?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. I happen to agree with <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/10/libya-politics-partisan-stephanie-cutter"" target=""_blank"">Adam Serwer</a> that Republican investigations into the Benghazi attack are legitimate even if they're politically inspired, but I also agree with him that these particular investigations have been ineffective precisely because they're so transparently partisan. There's just no evidence that Republicans really care about embassy security, only that they want to score some points in the runup to an election.</p>
<p>And here's point #8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States can't turn its diplomatic installations into armed camps. U.S. diplomats are going to need to take risks from time to time, and many of them are fully prepared to so. That said, it seems inevitable that this tragedy is going to have precisely the effect the State Department fears: more restrictions on diplomats' movements, more fortress-like facilities, and less interaction with the locals. American diplomacy will be the worse for it &mdash;&nbsp;and that will ultimately make us less safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope this point gets wide attention. Sometimes stuff happens, but that doesn't inevitably mean that a huge flurry of new rules have to be put in place. Unfortunately, that's usually what happens, and it's usually exactly the wrong thing to do.</p>"

This happened several months ago, and the changes from the HadCRUT3 series to the HadCRUT4 series were fairly minor, but I guess anything is a good excuse to <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html"" target=""_blank"">rerun one of their oldest wheezes:</a> a colorful chart that starts with the unusual temperature spike of 1997-98 to make it look like global warming has stopped.

<p>You know the rest of this story, right? It's a noisy data series, and if you choose any other starting point &mdash; 1996 or 1999 will do fine &mdash; the trendline looks quite different. A chart that includes the entire past century is below, and as you can see, it's easy to find several decade-long plateaus if you cherry pick the data just the right way.

<blockquote>
<p>Profits from high-speed trading in American stocks are on track to be, at most, $1.25 billion this year, down 35 percent from last year and 74 percent lower than the peak of about $4.9 billion in 2009....While no official data is kept on employment at the high-speed firms, interviews <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_hft.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />with more than a dozen industry participants suggest that firms large and small have been cutting staff, and in some cases have shut down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The usual wheeze to justify HFT is that it provides greater liquidity, which benefits even small traders. But the stock market had always had plenty of liquidity. It's a textbook model of liquidity. So there's really not much upside there, and the downside is that no one truly understands what all the HFT algobots are doing. Maybe they're harmless. Then again, maybe they only seem harmless when markets are calm. But when things get a little out of whack &mdash; in other words, at the worst possible time &mdash; there's no telling what the algobots will do. Their programmers certainly don't, and that's reason enough to think we should be pretty careful with this stuff.</p>
<p>But Felix Salmon highlights another reason we should keep HFT&nbsp;on a short leash. It turns out that HFT&nbsp;algobots don't actually do that much trading. What they do is produce massive amounts of financial spam: putting out buy and sell orders and then rescinding them almost instantly. In other words, <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/08/market-data-firm-spots-the-tracks-of-bizarre-robot-traders/60829/"" target=""_blank"">quote stuffing and market spoofing.</a> And the target of all this fake trading is....<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/15/why-theres-less-high-frequency-trading/"" target=""_blank"">other algobots:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call it the Stalemate of the Spambots: the HFT algos are all so sophisticated, now, that they just ping each other with order spam, rather than actually trading shares. Naturally, if you don&rsquo;t trade shares, you can&rsquo;t make money. But at the same time, anybody who does trade shares risks getting picked off by the very algorithms which are increasingly circling each other like prizefighters who never land a punch.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that just because HFT algobots aren&rsquo;t trading as much any more, doesn&rsquo;t mean that the waters are any safer for real-money accounts to re-enter. Indeed, the exact opposite is more likely: that the bots have poisoned the stock-trading waters so much that even the bots themselves fear to go in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Felix thinks the answer is a financial transaction tax. ""Let's not assume that rising trading costs are always and necessarily a bad thing,"" he says. <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/08/chart-day-algobot-wars-now-rule-wall-street"" target=""_blank"">I agree.</a> CEPR&nbsp;has more <a href=""http://www.cepr.net/documents/fst-facts-myths-12-10.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here.</a></p>"

So What?","8","-1","0","","2012-10-15 17:18:31","<p>Paul Waldman has some advice for President Obama in <a href=""http://prospect.org/article/time-try-romney-lying-debate-strategy"" target=""_blank"">tomorrow's debate:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize there's at least some chance that the President is too busy to be reading this blog today. But just in case, let me offer a suggestion. What Obama needs is a set of responses that cover the topic at hand, but that <em>all follow a single theme</em>. He needs, to put it bluntly, a single phrase that he will repeat every time he's refuting a Romney falsehood. It could be something slogan-y, like ""That's another Romney <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_romney_fire.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />Reinvention,"" or could be something simple, like ""Once again, Governor Romney thinks he can fool you and get away with it.""....When Romney lies, what Obama needs viewers to take away from the exchange isn't that there's some dispute about the details of policy, but that <em>Romney is lying</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, I'm pretty sure Paul is wrong about this. Partly this is because most viewers don't react well to charges of lying. They think it makes the accuser sound distinctly unpresidential. Partly it's because it's not easy to make charges of lying stick. Romney would simply reply with a blizzard of numbers and ""studies"" that would muddy the waters enough to blunt the attack. Mostly, though, it's because most voters don't care if politicians lie. That includes you.</p>
<p>You should think of presidential campaigns as aspirational, not operational. Voters know perfectly well that presidents don't accomplish most of what they say they will. So, reasonably enough, they don't care much about the details. What they <em>do</em> care about is what candidates <em>believe</em>. In Romney's case, his message is fairly simple. He believes in low taxes; less spending on lazy slackers; social conservatism; getting tough on our enemies overseas; and unleashing the power of business by cutting regulations. And he really does believe all this stuff. He may be evasive or even downright dishonest about the details of his tax cuts or how he'd get tough with Syria and Iran, but most people don't really care. It's enough to know that he <em>really does</em> want to cut taxes and he <em>really does</em> want to get tough with Syria and Iran.</p>

</div>
<p>And before you get all huffy about how stupid voters are, keep in  mind that this all applies to you too. Most of my readers are liberals.  You're planning to vote for Obama. So ask yourself: how much do you care  that Obama is sometimes a little less than perfectly accurate about his  plans? Not much at all, I'd guess. You either convince yourself that  his exaggerations are small ones, or that he's been forced into it by  Romney's serial lying, or that if you dig deep enough there are ways of  justifying everything he says. In other words, what matters aren't all  the arid details. What matters is that Obama believes most of the same  things you believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mitt Romney was not a businessman; he was a master financial speculator who bought, sold, flipped, and stripped businesses....That is the modus operandi of the leveraged-buyout business, and in an honest free-market economy, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much scope for it because it creates little of economic value. <strong>But we have a rigged system&mdash;a regime of crony capitalism&mdash;where the tax code heavily favors debt and capital gains,</strong> and the central bank purposefully enables rampant speculation by propping up the price of financial assets and battering down the cost of leveraged finance.</p>
<p>So the vast outpouring of LBOs in recent decades has been the consequence of bad policy, not the product of capitalist enterprise. I know this from 17 years of experience doing leveraged buyouts at one of the pioneering private-equity houses, Blackstone, and then my own firm. I know the pitfalls of private equity. The whole business was about maximizing debt, extracting cash, cutting head counts, skimping on capital spending, outsourcing production, and dressing up the deal for the earliest, highest-profit exit possible. Occasionally, we did invest in genuine growth companies, <strong>but without cheap debt and deep tax subsidies, most deals would not make economic sense.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the piece is mostly a detailed rundown of Bain's failures and successes, and it's interesting enough. But I wish Stockman had gone into more detail on the highlighted bits above. He's right that the Bain model &mdash; along with so much that Wall Street does &mdash; provides very little in the way of either social value or genuine economic growth. Only the tax preferences for both debt and capital gains make most private equity deals worth doing, something that's yet another argument for taxing capital gains more heavily than we do now. It's too bad Stockman doesn't provide chapter and verse on that to go along with his Mitt bashing. I guess it must have seemed a little too esoteric for the <em>Daily Beast</em> to be interested in.</p>"

<blockquote>
<p>The Bush foreign policy is a terrible brand&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roger that. The whole piece is worth a read. Romney has been pretty cagey about domestic policy, declining to take firm stands on healthcare, taxes, financial regulation, or, really, much of anything. But that's nothing compared to his slipperiness on foreign policy, which sounds increasingly like something out of an HBO sitcom. Romney wants to sound more like Reagan &mdash; but with a ""more cautious view of where and when we use force."" He wants to sound more forceful than Obama &mdash; but without actually suggesting he'd use force anywhere. He'll provide arms to the Syrians &mdash; but no, it turns out he won't. He has a different red line on Iran &mdash; but not really, it turns out. He'd handle the Arab Spring differently from Obama &mdash; except that he'd pretty much do exactly the same thing as Obama.</p>
<p>""The idea that Romney is following the George W. Bush approach is a caricature the Democrats want to draw,"" the anonymous advisor said. ""We're not going to help them with that."" Apparently not. Instead, they're just going to take so many different positions that nobody has any idea <em>what</em> approach they'd take.</p>"

That's not too surprising, but what <em>is</em> surprising is that the poll shows no post-debate surge for Romney. Obama was ahead by two points on September 29 and he's ahead by three points today.</p>
<p>More interesting is the chart below, showing that Obama outpolls Romney on every specific issue except for the deficit&mdash;which certainly attests to the power of brand management, since there's really no good reason to think that Romney would be any better at reducing the deficit than Obama. Quite the contrary, in fact: Romney has given us every reason to think that his real priorities are cutting taxes and raising defense spending. Aside from that, though, what I found most intriguing was the very strong belief that Obama would be better at handling an unexpected crisis. The ""no-drama Obama"" schtick might not work so well in a national debate, but in real life it sure seems to be a winner.</p>

He tried engaging with Bashar al-Assad. That didn't work. When war broke out, he tried brokering a settlement via the United Nations. That didn't work. Then he tried to get Vladimir Putin on his side. That didn't work either. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jackson-diehl-how-obama-bungled-the-syrian-revolution/2012/10/14/13c492d2-13b2-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html?hpid=z2"" target=""_blank"">So what now?</a></p>

<p>For the past three months, Obama&rsquo;s policy has become a negative: He is simply opposed to any use of U.S. power. Fixed on his campaign slogan that &ldquo;the tide of war is receding&rdquo; in the Middle East, Obama claims that intervention would only make the conflict worse &mdash; and then watches as it spreads to NATO ally Turkey and draws in hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters.</p>
<p>No doubt it&rsquo;s easier for Romney and the Republicans to talk about the death of an ambassador in a terrorist attack than to ask war-weary Americans to think about this. But it is Syria that is Obama&rsquo;s <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_syria_war.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 5px 15px 30px;"" />greatest failure; it will haunt whomever occupies the Oval Office next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These kinds of columns always stonker me. The reason is that nothing comes after these two paragraphs. Diehl spends 800 words disparaging Obama's failure in Syria&nbsp;&mdash; which is fair enough, up to a point &mdash; but won't tell us what he thinks Obama <em>should</em> have done. It's just like Paul Ryan's painfully evasive answer about Syria in <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-vice-presidential-debate-vice-president-biden-and-rep-paul-ryans-remarks-in-danville-ky-on-oct11-running-transcript/2012/10/11/a5167f1e-13cd-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_print.html"" target=""_blank"">last week's debate.</a> After Ryan went through the same stale bill of particulars that Diehl did, Joe Biden smiled and asked, ""What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he never answers the question."" That was true, and after a bit more filibustering Martha Raddatz asked Ryan <em>three times</em>, ""What&rsquo;s your criteria for intervention?"" He wouldn't answer.</p>
<p>Nobody ever does. Sure, we could provide arms directly to the rebels &mdash; though the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/middleeast/jihadists-receiving-most-arms-sent-to-syrian-rebels.html"" target=""_blank"">failure so far of indirect arms transfers</a> should give everyone pause for thought on that front. We could provide them with a bit more intelligence. We can keep trying to beef up sanctions. But that's penny ante stuff. It wouldn't make a big difference and everyone knows it. You'd need a sustained ground action or, at the least, a sustained bombing campaign to really make a dent.</p>
<p>We could do that, of course. We could send in ground troops. We could provide air cover for the rebels. We could lob cruise missiles into Damascus. But look. Since he took office, Obama has doubled our presence in Afghanistan. He's participated in an armed intervention in Libya. He's ramped up the drone campaign in Pakistan and Somalia by 10x. That's three wars. Do Ryan and Romney and Diehl and their friends really think we need yet another one? If they do, they should speak up plainly instead of pretending that if only Obama had waved his magic wand, Assad would already be out of power.</p>
<p>If you want us to go to war in Syria, have the guts to say so. If you don't, say that too. But if that's the case, at least have the grace to put a lid on the bluster and the fatuous recriminations. It's contemptible stuff.</p>"

Microsoft always just seemed big and clumsy and power hungry to me: I hated them, but mostly the way I hate earthquakes and hurricanes and bad drivers. Apple, on the other hand, has a corporate attitude carefully and cunningly designed to be as arrogant, unhelpful, and control freakish as it's possible for a corporation to be, all wrapped up in a marketing persona that's almost Orwellian in its winsomeness. It drives me crazy. One result of this newfound enmity has been an improbable infatuation with the current series of Galaxy S III ads, especially the one I've embedded on the right. I suppose I'll get over it soon. After all, I don't own any Samsung products and don't plan to.</p>

<p>Romney's an amazing guy, no? When it comes to things that bust the deficit, he's got lots of big ticket items he's happy to share with us. He wants to cut tax rates by $5 trillion. He wants to increase defense spending by $2 trillion. He wants to eliminate Obama's $716 billion in reduced Medicare payments to hospitals.</p>
<p>But when it comes to things that would <em>cut</em> the deficit, he's suddenly Mr. Small Ball. He'll defund PBS. He'll eliminate some tax deductions but won't say which ones. He'll cap Medicare growth, but then backs away from that. Has he ever even come close to owning a spending cut that would be anything other than peanuts compared to the budget busters he's already hung his hat on?

<blockquote>
<p>Vice President Joe Biden spent most of his 90-minute televised showdown with Paul D. Ryan on Thursday night looking like he was having the time of his life....You almost expected him to prop his feet up and say, ""Sonny, you just keep tellin' 'em.""</p>
<p>....Intimacy is just what Biden wanted. Smiling and more than occasionally laughing in apparent disbelief when Ryan spoke, flatly correcting him, repeatedly contradicting him and often interrupting him, Biden often seemed like he was sharing a joke with the audience. ""That's a bunch of malarkey,"" he said early on when Ryan accused the Obama administration of misleading the public about the nature of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conservatives seem to have decided that they're going all-in on Biden's demeanor as their primary point of attack, and this provides us with an excellent field study of working the refs. As near as I can tell, the general reaction <em>last night</em> was that Biden was pretty good: loose, aggressive, passionate, and taking no guff from Ryan. At worst, maybe he overdid things a bit, but that's all.</p>
<p>Question: will that consensus change as conservatives continue to hammer relentlessly on their theme that Biden was rude, condescending, obnoxious, creepy, unbearable, etc. etc.? I suspect it will, though perhaps less so than it would have a few years ago. Nonetheless, the right-wing reality-distortion machine is still pretty strong. This will certainly be a bigger topic of conversation today than it deserves to be.</p>"

Here's another crack at unpacking the basics behind the famous <a href=""http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/1001631-FAQ-Romney-plan.pdf"" target=""_blank"">TPC study</a> that originally made this point. It's actually pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Romney has promised a 20% across-the-board rate cut. The part of this cut that affects people making over $200,000 per year would reduce tax revenues by about $251 billion per year.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>But wait! What about the economic growth this will unleash? That's mostly mythical, but let's bend over backwards here. If you incorporate the growth estimate of one of Romney's advisors, Greg Mankiw, Romney's rate cuts for the wealthy would only cost about $215 billion per year.</li>
    <li>Next, try to pick out a set of deductions and loopholes that can be closed to make up for this revenue loss.</li>
    <li>But wait! Romney hasn't said exactly which deductions he would target. So it's not fair to pick and choose specific deductions. Fine. Instead, let's assume that Romney completely eliminates <em>every single deduction</em> for <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_star_trek_computer.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />high earners. All of them. It turns out this would make up $165 billion per year.</li>
    <li>So even under the best possible assumptions, Romney's plan would cut taxes on the rich by $50 billion per year.</li>
    <li>But Romney says he won't cut taxes on the rich.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the point at which, on <em>Star Trek</em>, smoke starts coming out of the computer and it implodes because it was forced to consider a logical impossibility. Here in the real world, it's the point at which conservatives desperately start trying to invent clever excuses. Martin Feldstein gave it a shot, but it turned out that he calculated wrong: Romney's plan can't work under Romney's conditions. It can only work if you eliminate deductions all the way down to people earning $100,000. Harvey Rosen gave it a shot, but succeeded only by assuming wildly implausible growth estimates. Charles Dubay gave it a shot, but miscalculated a provision of the estate tax. Matt Jensen gave it a shot, but made things work only by assuming that Romney might eliminate the interest exclusion on life insurance savings and state bonds. This is pretty unlikely, though, since a centerpiece of Romney's plan is to <em>cut</em> taxes on investment income, not raise them.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Romney knows all this. The guy ran Bain Capital for years. If there's anything he knows his way around, it's a spreadsheet. So is it fair to say flat-out that he's lying about his tax plan? I guess reasonable people can disagree, but I'd say it is. There really aren't any plausible assumptions under which his plan can work, and he obviously knows it. But he keeps saying it anyway. If that's not a lie, what is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We'll see how the remaining debates go, but it's interesting how now that issues that were (perhaps wrongly) for years seen as things Democrats had to be on defense about are seen more as strengths, they mostly disappear as issues. Immigration, Teh Gay Marriage, Abortion. Yes abortion made an appearance, but the question wasn't about abortion, it was about how Joe Biden could defy his church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know for sure why these topics were mostly absent, but after the debate I was musing about that too. We've had two debates now that have included endless discussions of taxes and economic plans, and sure, those are important topics. But let's face it: they're also deadly boring, and most viewers probably zone out pretty quickly. But how about gay marriage? Abortion? Gun rights? Immigration? Climate change? Drug laws? Religious liberty? I'll bet most voters are actually a lot more interested in those topics than they are in Syria or the optimal top marginal rate on millionaires, and yet they've been almost completely absent from the debates. Abortion and (relatedly) religious liberty got very brief mentions last night before Martha Raddatz got bored with them, and in last week's debate these topics got no attention at all.</p>
<p>Why? Is it because the moderators don't personally care about these things much? Is it because they somehow consider them less serious than questions about the economy? It certainly can't be because there's no disagreement between the parties on these issues. It's weird.</p>"
"854","http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/10/romney-ryan-medicaid","","The Romney-Ryan Plan to Obliterate Medicaid","8","-1","0","","2012-10-12 10:00:00","<p>Barrels of ink have been spilled over Medicare during this year's campaign. There's nothing wrong with that: Obama and Romney have fundamentally different approaches to Medicare and they deserve attention. Romney, for example, wants to increase the eligibility age to 67 and convert Medicare into a voucher system that relies primarily on competition between private firms to rein in costs. That's a big change. At the same time, the actual differences in what the two candidates would <em>spend</em> on Medicare is fairly modest. This is more a fight over means than ends.</p>
<p>The same can't be said for Medicaid. Romney wants radical changes here too, promising to ""block grant"" Medicaid if he's elected. This means the program would be turned over entirely to the states. The federal government would continue to provide a share of funding, but that funding would go straight into state coffers, and states could decide how to spend it. So the question is: Once released from federal regulations, what would states do with their Medicaid money?</p>

<p>Some states would probably try some genuinely interesting experiments, though it's unlikely we'll ever discover any magic bullets for reining in health care costs on a state level. But lots of states, especially poor states in the South, don't have much interest in experimenting. They just want to slash eligibility for Medicaid. Given the freedom to do it, they'd adopt what Ed Kilgore calls the <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_10/the_mississippi_model040248.php"" target=""_blank"">""Mississippi model,""</a> cutting off coverage for a family of three earning anything over $8,200. For all the talk of fresh thinking and new solutions, what they really want to do is simple: They want to stop providing medical care for poor people.</p>
<p>But that's not all. In this case, there's more than just differences in ideology at work. Unlike Medicare, which he's willing to fund at about the same rate as Obama, Romney <em>doesn't</em> want to spend as much on Medicaid as Obama does. In fact, he wants to take a chainsaw to it. Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt took a look at the Romney and Obama plans in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> this week, <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1379004"" target=""_blank"">and the chart above shows their conclusions.</a> On Medicare, the two candidates want to spend roughly similar amounts of money. On Medicaid, Romney wants to spend way, way less. And not just on poor people. <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/108435/romney-ryan-medicaid-block-grant-cut-elderly-nursing-home-ltc"" target=""_blank"">As Jon Cohn points out,</a> cuts of this size will have a huge impact on ""dual eligibles,"" elderly patients who rely on Medicaid to pay their nursing home bills. This is not a minor point of technocratic disagreement. It represents a massive change in our commitment to providing decent medical care for those who can least afford it. Medicaid, much more than Medicare, demonstrates what's really at stake in November's election.</p>"

""It&rsquo;s 10 percent. You know what it was  the day you guys came in&mdash;8.5 percent. That&rsquo;s how it's going all around  America."" That's so flatly wrong I'm honestly surprised Ryan was willing  to go there. The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October  2009. Last month it was down to 7.8 percent. <em>That's</em> how it's going all around, and Ryan knows it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARTHA RADDATZ: I recently spoke to a highly  decorated soldier who said that this presidential campaign has left him  dismayed. He told me, quote, ""<strong>The ads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other</strong> rather than building up the country."" What would you say to that American hero about this campaign?</p>
<p>RYAN: First of all, I'd thank him to his service to  our country&hellip;And then I would say, you have a president who ran for  president four years ago promising hope and change, who has now turned  his campaign into attack, blame and defame. <strong>You see, if you don't have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from.</strong> That was what President Obama said in 2008. It's what he&rsquo;s doing right now. Look at all the string of broken promises&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question was about negativity, and Ryan, without blinking, <em>immediately launched into a bitter negative attack.</em> I don't know how many people noticed this, but it sure struck me as badly off in tone.</p>
<p>Joe Biden very forcefully&mdash;and repeatedly&mdash;insisted tonight that Iran  was nowhere near getting a bomb and it wasn't really something to worry  about right now. Was this a good line to take? Substantively, he has a  good argument: Iran <em>isn't</em> close to getting a bomb, and Iran <em>doesn't</em>  have a delivery vehicle in any case. But 10 years of warmongering has  made me skeptical that this is a good tack to take. It sounds weak and  naive. I sure hope I'm wrong about that.</p>
<p>Andrew Sullivan, who had by far the biggest freakout over Obama's performance last week, <a href=""http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/live-blogging-the-biden-ryan-debate.html"" target=""_blank"">is apparently happier tonight:</a>  ""I have to say that Biden did to Ryan what Cheney did to Edwards [in  2004] in style and demeanor and authoritah. Ryan was hampered by an  insurmountable problem on the impossible mathematics of the Romney  budget. I think his inability to answer that question&mdash;how do you pay for  it?&mdash;has to be the driving question now.""</p>
<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/drgrist/status/256598509124476928"" target=""_blank"">David Roberts:</a>&nbsp; ""The GOP complaint, if I'm hearing them correctly, is that Joe Biden  smiled &amp; laughed too much while kicking their candidate's ass.""  Yeah, pretty much. The Fox News crowd is going absolutely nuts over  Biden's smiling and laughing. I guess I don't blame them, really. I  probably would too if I were them. Partly this is because I think Biden  overdid things on this score, but mostly because it's a lot easier than  trying to take on the substance of the debate, where Biden pretty  clearly got the better of Ryan. However, this will be a good test of the  right's ability to drive the media conversation. Conservatives are going all in about how condescending and inappropriate and just  plain insulting Biden's laughing was, and how it's really the big  takeaway from the debate. (Karl Rove: ""It's what people will remember 20  years from now."" Greta Van Susteren is just flatly insisting that this  ought to be the main media narrative in the morning.) But they're  obviously protesting too much. I don't think it will fly this time.</p>
<p>Martha Raddatz is getting good reviews from everyone except Sarah  Palin, who says ""Paul Ryan was underfoot"" the entire debate because  Raddatz let him run roughshod. Sean Hannity then made a remark about  Obama attending Raddatz's wedding 20 years ago. Good grief.</p>
<p>I thought Paul Ryan was unusually brazen in his defense of the  Republican insistence on extending the Bush tax cuts for the rich. Biden  made the reasonable point that you could easily vote separately on  extending the cuts for the middle class and extending the cuts for the  rich, but Republicans refuse to do that: ""They&rsquo;re holding hostage the  middle class tax cut to the super wealthy."" This was Ryan's response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, if you taxed every person and successful business making over  $250,000 at 100 percent, it would only run the government for 98 days.  If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small  businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we'd still have a  $300 billion deficit. You see? There aren't enough rich people and small  businesses to tax to pay for all their spending.</p>
<p>And so the next time you hear them say, ""Don't worry about it, we'll  get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,"" watch out, middle  class, the tax bill's coming to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's kind of breathtaking, no? First, he says that ending tax cuts  for the rich wouldn't solve the entire deficit problem all by itself, so  therefore we shouldn't do it. Huh? Then he attempts some jiu jitsu by  suggesting that if you're in favor of partly solving the deficit problem  with tax hikes on the rich, then ""watch out, middle class, the tax  bill's coming to you."" Double huh? I wonder if anyone fell for that?</p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/ezraklein/statuses/256568767457411072"" target=""_blank"">Ezra Klein tweets:</a>  ""Ryan is better at talking entitlements than Romney. He sounds excited  about the changes for his generation. Romney makes them sound terrible.""  There's some truth to this. Ryan has a remarkable ability to make his  cuts sound really appealing. I attribute this partly to the fact that he  really believes what he says, and partly to the fact that so many young  people are convinced that Medicare and Social Security won't be there  for them unless they're cut. They believe this, of course, mainly  because people like Paul Ryan have been telling them this for so long.</p>
<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/256577140777185280"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Todd:</a>  ""The Twitter liberals I follow seem incredibly fired up about Biden;  the Twitter conservatives I follow, seem incredibly fired up about  Biden."" It's true on Fox too. They're mostly obsessing over Biden's  demeanor, not Ryan's performance.</p>
<p>By the way, Biden didn't use the word ""literally"" a single time tonight.</p>
<p>And hey&mdash;how did the hack gap make out tonight? <a href=""http://twitter.com/matthew_cain/status/256606825653338112"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Cain:</a>&nbsp;""Starting to believe @kdrum."" <a href=""http://twitter.com/MichaelSLinden/status/256593968366772224"" target=""_blank"">Michael Linden:</a> ""@kdrum's hack gap is on full display tonight.

<p>Finally, what did my own personal focus group have to say about the debate? According to Marian, Ryan looked like an ""entry level"" vice president. Very perceptive, I'd say.</p>"

This set the tone for the entire debate: Biden was pretty hot throughout, openly laughing at Ryan's responses, getting testy even with Martha Raddatz at one point, and letting his anger show on three or four occasions. Generally speaking, I think he kept this under control, but not always. Ryan's calmer demeanor served him pretty well throughout. <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-vice-presidential-debate-vice-president-biden-and-rep-paul-ryans-remarks-in-danville-ky-on-oct11-running-transcript/2012/10/11/a5167f1e-13cd-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_print.html"" target=""_blank"">Transcript here.</a></p>
<p>Substantively, the discussion of taxes seemed like a draw. This is frustrating. The fact that Romney's plan doesn't add up is an obvious point of attack, and yet neither Biden nor Obama seems to have a well-rehearsed 60-second schtick to explain it. Maybe it's impossible. Maybe there's just no way to score a clean win in an argument that revolves around numbers and tax jargon. Biden pointed out the problems with the Romney tax plan, but Ryan then just flatly lied and insisted that Romney's plan <em>really did</em> add up. There's<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_debate_biden_laughing_2012_10_11.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" /> no plausible way that's true, and Biden tried to trap him on specific deductions, but Ryan just smiled his way through it. When Raddatz asked him he could guarantee that everything added up, Ryan said absolutely yes. How do you fight that in 60 seconds?</p>
<p>I thought the strongest part of the debate for Biden came on Afghanistan and Syria. On Afghanistan, he was surprisingly firm about the 2014 withdrawal deadline: ""We are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period."" And when Ryan responded with a primer on the fighting season, Biden had a good response: ""That's right, we&rsquo;re sending in more <em>Afghans</em> to do the job."" Not only is this an answer I like, but I think it's an answer the American public likes too. It also left Ryan flatfooted since he wanted to disagree, but couldn't really point to anything specific Romney would do differently. He sounded a bit petulant, disagreeing just for the sake of disagreement.</p>
<p>On Syria, Biden again did a good job of flatfooting Ryan on exactly what they'd do differently if they were in charge. Ryan had nothing to say, so he just retreated to talking points about how slowly everything had gone and how Romney would have done better by projecting strength and resolve. Or something. He didn't come out on top here.</p>
<p>I liked Raddatz's question about whether abortion supporters had reason to be worried if Romney were elected. The obvious answer is yes, but Ryan had to tap dance around it a bit. This probably didn't hurt him too much, especially since Raddatz cut off the segment pretty quickly, but it was a little weaselly.</p>
<p>On the economy generally, I'd score the debate a draw. Biden did a good job of defending the past four years, but not a good job of setting out a vision for the next four. This isn't his fault, though: Obama hasn't done much on this score, so there's no vision to tout. In the end, though, this didn't hurt him since Ryan couldn't do much better. He had a hard time defending his tax cuts for the rich and a hard time defending his Medicare plan. When Biden asked ""Who do you trust on this?"" my guess is that most people picked him over Ryan just because Biden was so obviously passionate about protecting the middle class. But I wouldn't swear to that.</p>
<p>Overall, I guess I'd score this about the opposite of Wednesday's debate: Biden gets a B, Ryan gets a B-.</p>
<hr width=""30%"" />
<p>Here we go. It's time to liveblog the 2012 vice presidential debate in Danville, Kentucky. Let's do this.</p>
<p><strong>10:33 -</strong> And that's a wrap.</p>
<p><strong>10:32 -</strong> Ryan's closing statement seems way too memorized. Just the same talking points he's used a bunch of times before.</p>
<p><strong>10:30 -</strong> In closing statement, Biden admits his ""frustration"" during the debate. That's probably a good concession. He did indeed sometimes seem a little too angry/frustrated at times. Ryan, by contrast, sometimes seemed a little exasperated.</p>
<p><strong>10: 28 -</strong> Whining about how much time you're getting is never a good idea. Period.</p>
<p><strong>10:27 -</strong> Ryan's strategy seems to be that no matter what the question is, the answer is a stump speech.</p>
<p><strong>10:26 -</strong> On the other hand, Ryan's attack was reasonably effective.</p>
<p><strong>10:25 - </strong>Raddatz asks what they'd say to a war vet who thinks campaigns are too negative. Biden gives decent, somber answer. Ryan immediately responds with negative attack. Sheesh.</p>
<p><strong>10:20 -</strong> Raddatz asks Ryan if voters should be worried about abortion rights if Romney elected. Ryan declines to answer. Biden's response pretty good. Raddatz moves on, which is probably good news for Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>10:18 -</strong> Biden on abortion: ""I accept it in my personal life. But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others.""</p>
<p><strong>10:14 -</strong> I'd score the Syria segment a win for Biden. He's correct that Romney has never really said what he'd do differently. When Raddatz asked Ryan about that, he stammered and retreated to talking points about the UN and Russia. And his criteria for intervention? ""The national interest."" No kidding. He had no answer.</p>
<p><strong>10:07 -</strong> Biden on troop drawdowns: ""That's right, we're sending in more <em>Aghans</em> to do the job.""</p>
<p><strong>10:06 -</strong> Not sure this whole fighting season thing is getting across to anyone, despite Ryan's efforts to ""explain"" everything.</p>
<p><strong>10:03 -</strong> Glad to hear Biden being so firm on 2014 timeline, but surprised too. Is this new?</p>
<p><strong>10:02 -</strong> Ryan: We agree with the timeline, but we don't want to broadcast our timeline to our enemies. Spare me.</p>
<p><strong>10:00 -</strong> Biden: ""It is the responsibility of the Aghans to take care of their own security."" Good response. ""We are leaving. We are leaving in 2014. Period.""</p>
<p><strong>9:56 -</strong> Overall, Biden's demeanor is pretty hot. Ryan is mostly fairly cool.</p>
<p><strong>9:55 -</strong> Not sure who came out on top on taxes. Too many numbers for most people to follow. Too easy for Ryan to just make flat claims and not have to back them up.</p>
<p><strong>9:54 -</strong> Biden: ""Can you guarantee that no one making less than $100,000 will have their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?"" Ryan not willing to answer.</p>
<p><strong>9:52 -</strong> Biden doing a good job of pointing out deductions that would have to be cut. &nbsp;Ryan just flatly lying about being able to fund rate cuts with deduction closures. But trotting out the usual excuses for not being willing to say how it would work.</p>
<p><strong>9:50 -</strong> Ryan's tax wonkery not working well. Raddatz: ""And you guarantee this math will add up?"" Ryan says ""absolutely.""</p>
<p><strong>9:49 -</strong> Ryan's basic tax message seems to be that raising taxes on the rich isn't enough to close the entire deficit, so it's obviously not worth doing. Um....</p>
<p><strong>9:48 -</strong> Wow. Ryan somehow trying to claim that if Obama won't cut taxes on the rich, that must mean he wants to increase taxes on the middle class. Smooth move if he gets away with it.</p>
<p><strong>9:45 -</strong> Uh oh. About to get in the weeds on taxes.</p>
<p><strong>9:40 -</strong> Biden interrupting too much.</p>
<p><strong>9:39 -</strong> Biden: ""Folks, follow your instincts on this one."" Romney/Ryan will slash Medicare.</p>
<p><strong>9:37 -</strong> Biden speaking directly to the camera: seniors have more benefits today than when we took office.</p>
<p><strong>9:33 -</strong> Generally speaking, Ryan is coming across as pretty credible so far. Biden is attacking him hard, but I'm not sure if he's being specific enough to do a lot of damage. However, the bit about Ryan writing letters asking for stimulus funds was pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>9:32 -</strong> Biden might need to cool it on the split screen laughter at Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>9:30 -</strong> Biden: ""If they'd get out of the way"" we'll create more jobs. Good attack on Republican obstructionism.</p>
<p><strong>9:26 -</strong> 47%! Plus a bonus 30%! Biden has ""had it up to here"" with Grover Norquist. He's sure a lot more animated about the economy than he was about Iran.</p>
<p><strong>9:20 -</strong> Bibi's my friend! I hope everyone knows who he's talking about.</p>
<p><strong>9:18: -</strong> I'm not sure that downplaying the Iranian bomb program is working for Biden.</p>
<p><strong>9:15 -</strong> Biden: If Republicans had been in charge of sanctions, the rest of the world never would have gone along. I wish Biden had expanded on that.</p>
<p><strong>9:13 -</strong> Not sure what happened to the ""Mr. Ryan"" thing.</p>
<p><strong>9:11</strong> - Raddatz is certainly taking a very different approach than Jim Lehrer did.</p>
<p><strong>9:09 -</strong> Biden: ""That's a bunch of malarkey."" Pretty strong comeback from the veep.</p>
<p><strong>9:06 -</strong> On Libya, Biden somber right off the bat. Ryan goes immediately into attack dog mode. A sign of things to come?</p>
<p><strong>9:00 -</strong> Programming note: Apparently Martha Raddatz is required to call Paul Ryan ""Mr. Ryan"" rather than ""Congressman Ryan."" This was part of the pre-debate negotiations. I gather that Ryan doesn't want to remind anyone that he's a member of one of the most feckless and detested institutions in America.</p>
<p><strong>8:59 -</strong> You want a prediction? Here's a prediction: this debate will be more or less a draw. Neither candidate will make any big mistakes, and neither will land any killer blows. Also: neither candidate will really try to get seriously into the weeds. They both know that this isn't where debates are won.</p>"

That was interesting, but sort of limited. What I was really curious about was how perceptions of Romney <em>as a person</em> changed. Did he seem more or less honest? More or less energetic? More or less plutocratic? Etc.</p>
<p>Well, John must have been reading my mind, because a few minutes ago he put up a post showing exactly that. Here are the before and after responses among independents for <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/11/romneys-debate-win-was-about-personality-more-than-policy/"" target=""_blank"">six specific character traits:</a></p>

<p>This is, obviously, pretty powerful stuff. It doesn't tell us whether these changes were mostly due to the debate performances themselves or to the media coverage afterward, but it certainly shows that perceptions of Romney and Obama shifted fairly dramatically. What's more, as John points out, Romney even gained in people's perceptions of his honesty. The fact that he tossed out so many specific numbers and plans, and tossed them out with confidence and vigor, apparently made people decide that he must be telling the truth.</p>
<p>You can draw your own conclusions from this. On the honesty front, there are two obvious lessons you could take away:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obama did a lousy job of making Romney's deceptions clear. He needs to double down on calling Romney a liar next week.</li>
    <li>Attacking Romney's honesty just doesn't work. No matter how gratifying it might be for us to hear him call Romney a liar, that's not the key to winning the next debate.</li>
</ol>
<p>My heart says #1 is right, but my head says #2 is right. Viewers just tune out when debates turn into a battle of numbers. The key to success lies elsewhere.</p>"

You remember the marshmallow test, don't you? Basically, you give kids a marshmallow and tell them they can either eat it now or, if they wait a few minutes, they can have two marshmallows. It turns out that the kids who are able to hold out do better later in life. It's a test of impulse control and delayed gratification, and both those traits are highly useful in modern society.</p>
<p>But hold on. What if you don't trust the researchers? If you don't believe that they <em>really will</em> return with two marshmallows, then there's not much point in showing any restraint, is there? You might as well just eat the marshmallow now. Some sneaky researchers at the <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_marshmallow_test.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 20px 15px 30px;"" />University of Rochester decided to test just that, <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/uor-tms101012.php"" target=""_blank"">setting up both ""reliable"" and ""unreliable"" environments for the kids:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the unreliable condition, the children were provided a container of used crayons and told that if they could wait, the researcher would return shortly with a bigger and better set of new art supplies for their project. After two and a half minutes, the research returned with this explanation: ""I'm sorry, but I made a mistake. We don't have any other art supplies after all. But why don't you use these instead?"" She then helped to open the crayon container.</p>
<p>Next a quarter-inch sticker was placed on the table and the child was told that if he or she could wait, the researcher would return with a large selection of better stickers to use. After the same wait, the researcher again returned empty handed.</p>
<p>The marshmallow task followed....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess what? When the kids got shafted by the researchers, they all ended up eating the marshmallow. They didn't really believe the extra marshmallow would ever appear. The kids in the reliable environment, where the researchers did what they said they would, mostly waited.</p>
<p>The researchers' conclusion is that self-control isn't a purely innate ability. It also depends on how you were brought up. If things tend to get taken away from you if you don't gobble them up right away, or if adults tend to make promises they don't keep, you're probably not going to be very interested in delayed gratification. In an environment like that, gratification delayed is gratification denied.</p>
<p>Now, despite the strong results these guys got, I'd still like to see their results replicated with different test setups and larger sample sizes. That said, however, this isn't really a counterintuitive finding. Most cognitive traits are combinations of both nature and nurture in one way or another, so it's no surprise that this one is too.</p>

Or, rather, he almost managed to get Romney to take a couple of deductions off the table. ""Let's go through how you would do that,"" Blitzer said. ""Specifically, home mortgage deductions, charitable contributions. Are you ready to remove those?"" Romney filibustered for a bit and <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2012/10/09/tsr-romney-interview-full.cnn?iref=videosearch"" target=""_blank"">then said:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With regards to the deductions you describe, home mortgage interest deduction and charitable contributions, there will of course continue to be preferences for those types of expenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. ""Preferences"" is still a bit weasel wordy, but it sure sounds like he's promising not to touch those items. In other words, he's making his promise of revenue neutrality ever more ridiculous with every passing day. All that's left is for someone to ask him whether he's willing to start taxing healthcare benefits. If he says no, that would pretty much take off the table every single tax expenditure of any serious size. There's just nothing left to balance out his rate cuts for millionaires.</p>"

Sorry about that. But <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/the-imf-and-the-gop/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Krugman</a> has a pretty interesting one this morning from the latest <a href=""http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/pdf/c1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">IMF World Economic Outlook.</a> Here's the background: the IMF report shows that countries which implemented big budget-cutting austerity measures have done worse than countries that didn't. That part is easy. But it doesn't prove <img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""image image-_original"" src=""http://www.motherjones.com/files/images/blog_imf_austerity_forecast.jpg"" style=""border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px 5px 15px 30px;"" />anything. Countries that are in bad trouble are probably the ones that had to cut back the most in the first place. So it's not necessarily austerity that's causing their problems.</p>
<p>So the IMF boffins took a look at forecasts instead. After all, forecasters already know which countries are in the biggest trouble and make their predictions after taking that into account. But guess what? It turns out that their forecasts were <em>more wrong</em> for countries that implemented severe austerity programs. And they were wrong by a lot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We find the coefficient on planned fiscal consolidation to be large, negative, and significant....Overall, depending on the forecast source and the specification, our estimation results for <strong>the unexpected output loss associated with a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation are in the range of 0.4 to 1.2 percentage points.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So forecasters, knowing that, say, Greece was in trouble, predicted a slowdown in growth. But the austerity program forced on the Greeks slowed them down even more. Conversely, countries like Germany, that expanded their budgets, did better than expected. Roughly speaking, it turns out that you get an output loss of 1% for every 1% of austerity.</p>
<p>This is a clever bit of data analysis, though it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. Austerity simply isn't the answer to a severe economic downturn. It just makes things even worse than you thought they'd be.</p>"

George Will of the Washington Post is man familiar with the uses (and perhaps the nefarious uses) of quantitative data.  <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-will-too-big-to-maintain/2012/10/12/9f8f8e94-1497-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html"">He tells us</a> 5 banks hold assets equal to 60% of the GDP.

Will?s basically Conservative bent leads him to not be fond of the Dodd-Frank Act inflicted upon American Industry by the current Obama Regime.  I certainly agree and sympathize with this point of view.  However, not liking Dodd-Frank is one thing, getting rid of it and the systematic problems that made its overreach tenable is a taller order than merely quantified complaining.  To actually dismantle the TBTF Empire and the implicit guarantee it enjoys via Dodd-Frank, it may help us to indulge in some Presidential History involving too great men.  President Andrew Jackson foresaw and attempted to prevent this problem.  President Theodore Roosevelt solved TBTF in some industries other than banking.<div class=""feedflare"">

In today's New York Times, Ross Douthat tries to understand why the Obama regime has lied so shamelessly and incoherently over the attacks on our Benghazi consulate. He overlooks the obvious: this regime always turns to the lie any time it is under stress and the atmospherics of admitting it had turned Libya over to al Qaeda for a short term political gain.<div class=""feedflare"">

Two women from two different perspectives have divergent points of view on why the attack of the US Embassy in Benghazi, Libya has remained news.  One woman, Obama?s Mouth of Sauron, Stephanie Cutter, approaches the issue from altitude and distance.  Another woman, the mother of the now departed Sean Smith, wants to know how her son died, and why the US Government doesn?t give her answers.  The contrast is telling.  It tells us just how far away the Obama Administration is from the actual concerns of the <i>Little Guy</i> they so piously claim to serve and defend.</p>

Jeff Emanuel <a href=""http://www.redstate.com/2012/10/11/obama-campaign-official-stephanie-cutter-benghazi-terrorist-attack-only-an-issue-because-of-romney-and-ryan"">gave Red State readers a good description</a> of Stephanie Cutter?s spin.  The spin shows an obdurate lack of basic human empathy for the dead.  It shows just how utterly self-preservationist the administration has been concerning the events of September 11, 2012 in Benghazi Libya.  Cutter is shown below claiming the issue only has traction because Mitt Romney is exploiting it.</p><div class=""feedflare"">

First, the U.S. coal industry <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/31/the-decline-of-u-s-coal-in-three-charts/"">really is in decline</a> ? the nation is burning far less coal to generate electricity than it did five years ago. Second, the Environmental Protection Agency under President Obama really has enacted a bunch of new rules that will require coal-fired power plants to <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-to-tally-up-the-benefits-from-epas-mercury-rule/2011/12/22/gIQAvnLzBP_blog.html"">curb their pollution</a>. Those rules will all cost money.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/06/24/Health-Environment-Science/Images/72221349.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>But it?s not true that the Obama administration is wholly responsible for coal?s current decline. That?s the argument that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have made lately, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/09/27/mitt_romney_s_war_on_the_war_on_coal_why_go_after_a_shrinking_voter_base_.html"">accusing</a> Obama of waging a ?war on coal.? The charge isn?t entirely correct. The U.S. coal industry would be struggling even without Obama?s pollution rules. Coal?s biggest problem at the moment is the recent influx of cheap natural gas in the United States. And that?s a situation that even Mitt Romney would have a hard time reversing.</p> <p>One way to see this is by checking out <a href=""http://www.brattle.com/_documents/UploadLibrary/Upload1082.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the latest report</a> (pdf) from the Brattle Group, an industry consulting firm (<a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/yes-coal-is-dying-but-no-epa-is-not-the-main-culprit/"">via</a> Grist?s David Roberts). There?s some grim news in here for the coal industry. Between 59 and 77 gigawatts worth of coal capacity will likely be retired by 2016 ? somewhere between one-fifth and one-quarter of the country?s coal-fired plants. That?s larger than previous estimates. But, the Brattle report concludes, the recent uptick in retirements has largely been driven by market forces:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>This 2012 reassessment indicates that somewhat more retirements are likely (about 25 GW) than we foresaw in late 2010. <strong>However, that change is primarily due to changing market conditions, not environmental rule revisions</strong>, which have trended towards more lenient requirements and schedules.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Over the past few years, natural gas has become extraordinarily cheap, thanks to refined drilling techniques <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/21/will-the-u-s-export-fracking-to-the-rest-of-the-world/"">that allow</a> companies to extract more gas from shale rock. And, to a lesser extent, wind turbines have been <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/14/the-rise-and-possible-fall-of-u-s-wind-power-in-five-charts/"">sprouting up around the country</a> and are getting steadily cheaper. The result? Both energy sources are displacing coal, spurring an additional wave of retirements?even as regulations have become slightly more lenient.</p> <p>In certain states like West Virginia, meanwhile, the coal-mining industry faces a structural decline that goes beyond federal regulations. Mining jobs have been slowly dwindling for 40 years, thanks to competition from Wyoming?s vast Powder River Basin as well as the advent of mountaintop-removal mining (which requires fewer miners to go underground). What?s more, as Ken Ward Jr. <a href=""http://wvgazette.com/News/MiningtheMountains/201210130087"">recently reported</a>, the coal in some Appalachian seams is gradually running out:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>Across West Virginia?s southern coal counties, such talk suggests that coal?s best days might be just around the corner, if regulators can be made to back off or new technology can capture dangerous emissions.</p> <p>There?s just one problem: Analysts agree that much of the best coal in Southern West Virginia has already been mined. Thinner and lower-quality seams are left, meaning production and productivity are dropping. Tough competition from inexpensive natural gas and other coal basins makes matters worse. New environmental restrictions only add to coal?s problems, and production is headed down regardless of air or water pollution restrictions.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Now, none of this is to suggest that the Obama coal regulations are insignificant or meaningless. For one, those air-pollution rules will certainly impose additional costs on the power sector and the coal industry ? utilities will have to spend <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-to-tally-up-the-benefits-from-epas-mercury-rule/2011/12/22/gIQAvnLzBP_blog.html"">about $9.6 billion per year</a> by 2016 just to mop up their mercury emissions. (Granted, the EPA also expects the rule to produce health benefits of between $37 billion to $90 billion per year.) That makes burning coal more expensive and more vulnerable to competition from cheap natural gas at the margins.</p> <p>Indeed, even the Brattle Group analysts agree that government regulations on air and water pollution will affect the pace of retirements. The report has a whole host of different forecasts for future coal-plant retirements, depending on how gas prices evolve and on whether the EPA?s regulations are ?lenient? or ?strict?:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/coal-retire.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/coal-retire.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>Check out the first column. If natural gas prices evolve as expected (i.e., rising slowly over time) and EPA regulations remain ?lenient,? then utilities are expected to retire 59 gigawatts of coal capacity by 2016 ? about one-fifth of the coal fleet. By contrast, if those EPA regulations get cranked up to ?strict,? then about 77 gigawatts of coal capacity gets retired. So regulations can make a difference, but natural gas is the big wildcard here.</p> <p>Now, granted, if Congress or the Obama administration wanted to declare a serious ?war on coal,? that would certainly be possible. As the chart above shows, if Congress levied a carbon tax worth $30 per ton by 2020, then U.S. utilities would likely retire about half of the coal fleet by 2016. A similar scenario could also occur if the EPA comes out with new rules for regulating carbon-dioxide from existing power plants, a decision <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/why-does-the-epa-have-such-an-odd-way-of-regulating-pollution/2012/03/28/gIQAFioNgS_blog.html"">that has been postponed</a> until after the election. Coal is the most carbon-intensive power source around, so any climate-change regulations would likely hurt conventional coal plants.</p> <p>But so far, the Brattle Group report notes, the Obama administration has avoided that sort of overly aggressive approach. Two of the EPA?s recent regulations ? the mercury rule and the cross-state air pollution rule ? were finalized ?with less restrictive requirements on the compliance deadlines and equipment than previously predicted.? (The cross-state rule <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-05/epa-seeks-rehearing-of-cross-state-air-pollution-ruling"">was later struck down</a> by the U.S. Court of Appeals.)</p> <p>In short: The U.S. coal industry is definitely hurting. But cheap natural gas is inflicting most of the pain. And, yes, it?s possible that the Obama administration could do even more to phase out coal use down the road ? either by restricting U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions more tightly or by further cracking down on things like coal ash.

But this wasn?t a normal recession. This was a global financial meltdown. So when asking whether our economic policymakers have done a good job, we need to ask, compared to what?</p> <p>For the Romney campaign, the ?compared to what?? test is easy, and the Obama administration failed it. ?The historical record is clear,? wrote four of their economists in a <a href=""http://www.docstoc.com/docs/125714335/Romney-Tax-Reform-White-Paper"">white paper</a> released by the campaign. ?Our economy usually recovers quickly from recessions, and the more severe the recession, the faster the subsequent catch-up growth.? The absence of a quick recovery, they went on to argue, shows that ?America took a wrong turn in economic policy in the past three years.?</p> <p>That argument relied mainly on the work of Michael Bordo and Joseph Haubrich, who had shown that the American economy typically recovers swiftly from recessions. But when I <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/08/economists-to-romney-campaign-thats-not-what-our-research-says/"">contacted</a> Bordo, he didn?t see this case as typical. ?We found that a lot of the difference between what would?ve been predicted by the normal behavior of recessions and what we observed now is explained by the collapse of residential investment,? he said. ?Put another way, if residential investment were what it was in a normal recovery, we would have recovered already.?</p> <p>The unquestioned authorities on major financial crises and their lengthy hangovers are Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, the authors of ?This Time is Different,? the key history of the subject. And, in a <a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/rogoff/files/Is_US_Different_RR.pdf"" target=""_blank"">new paper</a>, they try to set the record straight: ?The aftermath of the U.S. financial crisis has been quite typical of post-war systemic financial crises around the globe. If one really wants to focus just on United States systemic financial crises, then the recent recovery looks positively brisk.?</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/systemic-banking-crises-us.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/systemic-banking-crises-us.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>The problem, they say, is that many of the attempts to look at this question ? and, in particular, the politically motivated attempts to look at this question ? have tried to compare our financial crisis with both normal recessions and what are called ?borderline financial crises.? But what we had wasn?t a normal recession nor a borderline financial crisis (a term that comes from important work done by the World Bank in the ?90s). What we had was a systemic crisis. And by that measure, we?ve done pretty well.</p> <p>What Reinhart and Rogoff saw when they compared our crisis with others in the same category is that we did a much, much better job at the beginning. ?We have put a much higher floor on the initial contraction,? Reinhart says. ?The initial contraction in these crises is unambiguously worse in most cases.?</p> <p>That speaks well of the emergency measures we put in place in 2008 and 2009: TARP and the Federal Reserve?s efforts and the stimulus. But since then, our recovery has proceeded at a depressingly normal pace ? evidence, perhaps, that we weren?t particularly wise to take our foot off the economic accelerator in 2011 and 2012. </p> <p>Reinhart and Rogoff?s findings are confirmed by <a href=""http://voxeu.org/article/fact-checking-financial-recessions"">a similar study</a> by Moritz Schularick and Alan Taylor. They use a measure of pre-crisis credit build-up to sort more than 200 recessions since 1870. Once you account for the build-up of debt in our shadow banking sector, our contraction puts us firmly at the high end of their study ? but our results have been somewhat better, largely because of our strong initial efforts to avoid a total collapse.</p> <p>?The U.S. has done quite well,? Schularick and Taylor write, ?steering out of the to-be-expected financial recession range based on the inherited level of excess credit, especially if the shadow system is considered. Most importantly a deep financial recession was avoided at the outset, and this level effect remained intact.?</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/taylor_new4.png""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/taylor_new4.png"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>So what can we say? Historically speaking, the United States did a great job averting a depression. It?s less clear that we?re outrunning the historical record on the recovery.</p> <p>The economists had some theories on why that might be. ?I have to wonder whether nationalizing banks during a crisis is the cleanest and swiftest way out,? says Reinhart. ?Anything that delays the adjustment, that delays taking the hit, delays the recovery. The recovery in emerging markets is quicker not because policymakers are better but because there?s no choice: They have no resources to sustain a delay. I think taking the hit with the write-offs, even if it meant more propping up or taking over of institutions, cleans the air and cleans the balance sheets.?</p> <p>Taylor, for his part, emphasized that fiscal policy was counterproductive at the state and local level, where balanced budgets reigned. At the federal level, he said, ?we did better. But it?s an open question whether we could?ve done better still.?</p> <p>Which brings up another ?compared to what?? question. Since the 2010 midterms, the path of economic policy has been quite different than what the White House would have preferred. The debt-ceiling brinksmanship derailed strong growth in 2011, for instance, and the American Jobs Act hasn?t come anywhere near passing.</p> <p>It?s a fact of politics that presidents get more credit and more blame than they deserve for economic events, but it?s also true that when facing a divided Congress, they get more credit and blame than they deserve for the path of economic policy. There?s little doubt that Obama had more influence over the path of economic policy in his first two years, when we were working to avert a depression, than he has since the 2010 midterm election, when Republicans won the power to block most everything he wanted to do.</p> <p>Perhaps not coincidentally, we seemed to have performed rather more impressively in 2009 and 2010 than we did in 2011 or 2012.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/248153de/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544972737/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/248153de/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544972737/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/248153de/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544972737/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/248153de/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Will others follow?","3","-1","0","","2012-10-15 18:37:52","<p>The United States spends<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/we-spend-750-billion-on-unnecessary-health-care-two-charts-explain-why/""> $750 billion</a> annually on health care that does not make us any healthier. The world?s oldest private cancer center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York City, announced Monday a surprising step to bring down that number. It will not offer patients a $11,000 per month cancer drug called Zaltrap.</p> <p>Simply put, top executives do not believe the drug is worth the price tag. Here?s Peter Bach, Leonard Saltz and Robert Wittes <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/opinion/a-hospital-says-no-to-an-11000-a-month-cancer-drug.html"">in Monday?s New York Times</a>: </p> <p> <blockquote> <p> <em>The drug, Zaltrap, has proved to be no better than a similar medicine we already have for advanced <a href=""http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/colon-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"">colorectal cancer</a>, while its price ? at $11,063 on average for a month of treatment ? is more than twice as high.</em> </p> <p> <em>In most industries something that offers no advantage over its competitors and yet sells for twice the price would never even get on the market. But that is not how things work for drugs.</em> </p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Health care is not like most other industries. As the Sloan-Kettering officials note, Medicare is required to cover any FDA-approved drug without regard for price or efficacy. Doctors often cite pressure from patients, who want the latest treatment ? even if it?s not the greatest. Some worry about what it would mean for their practice if they simply turned down requests for a drug they don?t think will help. </p> <p>The Sloan-Kettering executives think that the less expensive choice is also the right one for patients.</p> <p>National cancer treatment guidelines say that a drug that costs half as much, Avastin, works equally as well as Zaltrap for advanced colorectal cancer. It also comes at a smaller cost to the patient. Bach, Saltz and Witties estimate that a privately insured individual ? would have to pay more than $2,200 out of pocket for a month?s treatment with Zaltrap.?</p> <p>Sloan-Kettering knows this won?t significantly bring down unnecessary health-care spending ? more realistically, it will barely make a dent. Instead, they see it as ?a step in the right direction ? one of many we need to take.?</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/248153dc/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544972736/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/248153dc/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544972736/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/248153dc/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544972736/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/248153dc/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

But man, it?d sure be nice if you could. That?s the conclusion of a new report from two economists at the Cleveland Fed, who say that the downturn in 2009 called for Fed interest rates to actually be negative ? if only that were possible.</p> <p>This is the main dilemma for central banks during deep recessions like the one from which we?re currently emerging. In normal times, if a slump is coming, the Fed and its counterparts in other countries will slash interest rates. If the rate was 5 percent and the Fed slashed it to 2, that reduces banks? incentive to hoard money and encourages lending, which in turn boosts the economy.</p> <p>But what happens when interest rates are already extremely low, and that?s not enough to take the economy out of its slump? The Fed?s rate is currently set at a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent. You can?t go much lower than that without things getting real weird. Negative interest rates basically mean that the bank is charging you money to stash your savings with them. In that situation, many people would just hold cash, which at least has a 0 percent return.</p> <p>There are some situations where this isn?t practical. Large companies aren?t going to go all ?Breaking Bad? and just keep <a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9s8nck17e1rq4tpko1_500.png"">big piles of $100 bills</a> around. Indeed, Sweden has tried a negative 0.25 percent interest rate on bank reserves, with <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/five-economic-lessons-from-sweden-the-rock-star-of-the-recovery/2011/06/21/AGyuJ3iH_story.html"">encouraging results</a>, suggesting the impediments to holding cash are big enough for negative rates to work.</p> <p>But there are workarounds. Kenneth Garbade and Jamie McAndrews at the New York Fed <a href=""http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/08/if-interest-rates-go-negative-or-be-careful-what-you-wish-for.html"">warned</a> earlier this year that negative interest rates would lead to ?special purpose banking,? in which companies offer effectively sky-high returns by promising to just keep peoples? money in the form of cash. Garbade and McAndrews also envision people delaying depositing checks, knowing that if they put it in their bank account immediately, it?ll start losing value. To avoid these problems altogether, you?d need to take a drastic step like abolishing paper currency. While some, like Citigroup?s Willem Buiter, have <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/05/09/william_buiter_digital_currency.html"">proposed just that</a>, it doesn?t seem in the offing for any countries anytime soon.</p> <p>Which is too bad, since the data suggest that we really needed negative interest rates in 2009. I did some <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/25/an-alternative-history-of-the-fed-from-2008-to-present/"">back of the envelope math</a> a while back showing that under popular policy rules for determining interest rates, rates should have reached close to -4 percent in 2009. Now, two economists at the Cleveland Fed, Ellis Tallman and Saeed Zaman, <a href=""http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/Commentary/2012/2012-15.cfm"">argue</a> that, if anything, that?s too timid. They believe rates should have reached -5 percent:</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/cleveland_negative_rates.png"" /> </p> </p> <p>The red line is the actual policy the Fed has taken, and the blue line is the policy which Tallman and Zaman estimate would have been taken if the Fed followed past patterns for changing rates. The rate, if the Fed followed past policies, would have dipped to -5 percent in mid-2009, and still be around -2 percent today. What?s more, the results are statistically significant at a 90 percent level, as you can see from the fact that even the upper 90 percent confidence bound is negative until the start of 2011.</p> <p>The Fed has tried to get around this through quantitative easing, and fiscal stimulus as implemented by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is another way of <a href=""http://www.lerner.udel.edu/economics/WorkingPapers/2006/UDWP2006-14.pdf"" target=""_blank"">getting around the ?zero lower bound.?</a> Some, like Columbia?s Michael Woodford, have <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/15/michael-woodford-i-personally-would-have-gone-further-but-what-the-fed-did-is-definitely-a-step-in-the-right-direction/"">suggested</a> getting around it by making promises about how long interest rates will stay at zero, an approach which the Fed has also adopted in a limited form and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/04/inside-the-fed-why-you-should-expect-an-unemployment-target/"">appears set to embrace</a> wholesale.</p> <p>But as Tallman and Zaman show, one wouldn?t even need to get that creative if the Fed were able to go negative. And given that the Fed acts faster to change interest rates than to do more exotic things like QE, and that Congress acts much more slowly than the Fed ever does, that could have sped up the recovery.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/247ffebf/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144545031953/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247ffebf/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144545031953/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247ffebf/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144545031953/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247ffebf/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

It?s worth keeping in mind, though, that that?s a big ?if.? The Romney-Ryan proposal would hold off a decade before transitioning to this system.</p> <p>What Kaiser did was pretty simple. Its researchers modeled what would happen if seniors received a set amount from the government to pay for their Medicare benefits. That check would be equal to second-lowest bid from a private, Medicare Advantage plan. That?s the same benchmark used in the Ryan Budget, Romney-Ryan proposal and the Domenici-Rivlin proposal.</p> <p>That was step one. Step two was looking at whether that check would cover the cost of providing Medicare benefits under the traditional or private plans, in a given area. For 59 percent of seniors, it wouldn?t: 25 million seniors would pay more for their current benefits if the government enacted this premium support model right now.</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/medicare-advantage.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/medicare-advantage.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>In the middle column above, you see that about half of seniors on traditional Medicare would end up paying more. There?s a split for seniors on the same plan because the Medicare benchmark gets set differently for different areas of the country (health care in California tends to be more expensive than medical services in neighboring Nevada).</p> <p>This is the scenario if all seniors stay in the exact same Medicare plan. But there?s a decent chance some seniors wouldn?t: The higher bills could make them think twice about the benefit package that they?re buying. Kaiser looks at scenarios where a number of seniors ? between 15 and 25 percent ? switch to that baseline plan, the second-cheapest. If 25 percent of seniors switch, then those paying more for benefits drops to 35 percent.</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/medicare-advantage-3.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/medicare-advantage-3.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>There would be a lot of geographic variation too. As the Kaiser analysts explain, ?In some parts of the country, private plan bids are lower than the costs of traditional Medicare.? In other parts, they are higher ? meaning that seniors might even stay on a low-cost private plan <em>and </em>receive a rebate. Either way, this creates big geographic differences in how far a Medicare voucher would go.</p> <p>This map looks at the percent of seniors who would expect to pay at least $100 more each month under the premium support scheme:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/medicare-advantage-2.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/medicare-advantage-2.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>?The share of beneficiaries subject to higher premiums if they remained in their same plan would vary greatly by state,? Kaiser notes, ?Ranging from less than two percent of beneficiaries in Alaska and the District of Columbia to more than 90 percent of beneficiaries in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey.?</p> <p>There are a few factors to keep in mind when thinking about these results. This study captures what would happen if, right now, premium support went into effect. It does not capture how private Medicare plans would react to that new market. </p> <p>Right now, there are some pretty big incentives for private Medicare plans to make their bids lower than the expected cost of health care. (The reasons are a bit complicated and laid out in more detail <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/22/does-medicare-advantage-cost-less-or-does-it-cost-more/"">here</a>). If private plans decided to raise their bids by 25 percent, only 34 percent of seniors would find that their voucher check did not cover their traditional Medicare premium. But that would also mean the system wouldn?t save much money.</p> <p>There?s also the possibility that government-run Medicare could change. One big goal of the Affordable Care Act, after all, is to make the insurance plan more cost-efficient by <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/acomg-the-regulation-could-determine-the-future-of-health-care/2011/10/20/gIQAMz3b0L_blog.html"">changing doctors? financial incentives</a>. If Medicare became 10 percent less expensive, the Kaiser analysis estimates that the number of seniors who paid more would again drop by double-digits.</p> <p>If the Romney-Ryan reforms work as planned, a lot of these changes would indeed happen ? driving down Medicare costs in the process. Seniors might take a second look at their Medicare plan and decide to go with a less expensive option. Medicare may become more aggressive in rooting out inefficiencies to stay competitive, again lowering health-care costs.</p> <p>There are a lot of unknowns about Medicare?s future, variables that are pretty crucial to understanding what premium support would mean for seniors. What we do know, right now, is this: Implementing a premium support system right now would mean higher costs for the majority of seniors.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/247f9c17/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544963247/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247f9c17/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544963247/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247f9c17/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544963247/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247f9c17/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Retail vehicle sales also saw a 1.3 percent increase in September, and building materials sales rose 1.1 percent.</p> <p>But the rising confidence has also left some analysts scratching their heads. ?Admittedly, gasoline prices fell marginally and the recovery in housing may have played a role,? says Amna Asaf, an economist with London-based research firm Capital Economics. ?But equity prices have fallen back too, employment growth remains lackluster and, unless Congress acts to avert the fiscal cliff, households are only two months away from a big jump in marginal tax rates.?</p> <p>The fiscal cliff is also poised to hit ordinary Americans directly through the expiration of the payroll tax holiday in 2013.

Social Security is to raise the retirement age, which would particularly hurt seniors who retire early at age 62.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/social-security.jpeg.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p> <blockquote> <p>What do we know about the people who retire at 62? On average, they have a shorter life expectancy and lower earnings than people retiring at later ages. If anyone stood up and said, ?Instead of doing uniform across the board cuts, let?s make them a little worse for people who have shorter life expectancies and lower earnings,? they?d be laughed at.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Of course, those who say we should raise the Social Security retirement age ? either the age of eligibility or the age for full benefits ? don?t get laughed at. It?s considered a very thoughtful, courageous effort to deal with our entitlement programs. People who mention it often make a joke of how brave they?re being. For instance, here?s New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) at <a href=""http://floridapundit.com/2011/02/chris-christie-we-have-to-raise-the-retirement-age-for-social-security/"">an American Enterprise Institute event</a>:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>You are going to have to raise the retirement age for Social Security! Whoa! I just said it and I am still standing here. I did not vaporize into the carpeting.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>Big applause, of course.</p> <p>This is one of Washington, D.C.?s more disagreeable conceits. The people wandering around calling for a higher retirement age will never feel the bite of the policy. Think tankers and politicians and columnists don?t retire at age 62, or even age 65. They love their work, which mostly requires sitting down in air-conditioned rooms. They stick around pretty much until they?re about to die.</p> <p>The courage it takes to call for a higher retirement age is the courage to say that other people who don?t have it as good as you do should be the ones to pay to shore up Social Security. It?s the same kind of courage as a poor person calling for higher taxes on the rich, or a sitting congressman calling for a war he?ll never have to fight in.</p> <p>Meanwhile, you could do more to erase Social Security?s shortfall by simply lifting the payroll tax cap. A lot more. According to <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11580/07-01-ssoptions_forweb.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the Congressional Budget Office</a>, raising the federal retirement age to 70 would solve about half of Social Security funding problem, while lifting the payroll tax cap would solve all of it.</p> <p>As it happens, lifting the payroll tax cap would also end up costing eminent think tankers and journalists and lobbyists and politicians a whole lot of money. Perhaps consequentially, it?s a rather less popular policy idea in this town. Many consider it an easy way out, even though it would be much harder on them.

While notable within their field, they?re hardly household names. But their work is hugely relevant to policymaking, especially in fields that one doesn?t think of as economic in nature. Here?s what you need to know about each of them.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/alroth.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p> <strong>Al Roth</strong> </p> <p>Roth, who is <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Stanford-Lures-3-Top/132317/"">new at Stanford</a> this fall after several years at Harvard Business School, is an expert at ?market design,? or the creation of matching systems or other mechanisms in situations in which normal markets are, for whatever reason, impracticable. He is perhaps best known for designing the system that matches graduating American medical students with residency programs and the mechanism the New York public school system uses to pair students and schools, the latter of which he worked on alongside Atila Abdulkadiroglu and Tayfun Sonmez.</p> <p>He is also notable, with Sonmez, for creating an innovative ?kidney swap? program. Normally, people who want to donate kidneys to a sick family member with an incompatible blood type are stuck. But Roth had the idea of pairing up such families and having them swap organs. For example, suppose Jane Smith (who?s B+) wants to give her brother John (who?s A-) her kidney. But John would reject the organ because it?s the wrong blood type. Roth?s system would match the Smiths with the Lees: George (who?s A-), who wants to donate, and Jill (who?s B+) who needs a kidney. Jane Smith gives Jill Lee one of her kidneys, and George Lee gives John Smith one of his, both of which match. Instead of neither getting a kidney, both do.</p> <p>Roth has been the subject of two excellent profiles, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0809/opinions-harvard-alvin-roth-freakonomics-ideas-opinions.html"">one</a> by Forbes?s Susan Adams and <a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/04/03/the_matchmaker/"">another</a> by the Boston Globe?s Leon Neyfakh, focusing on his efforts to apply his work in practice, through programs like the kidney swap. He also <a href=""http://marketdesigner.blogspot.de/"">writes a blog</a> aimed at a general audience ? suitably titled ?Market Designer? ? which he <a href=""http://marketdesigner.blogspot.de/2012/10/blog-may-be-delayed-today.html"">updated</a> Monday morning to warn that the ?Blog may be delayed today?Count me as surprised.?</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/lloydshapley.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p> <strong>Lloyd Shapley</strong> </p> <p>Shapley, 89, may not yet know that he?s won the prize. He lives on the West Coast, and the Nobel committee <a href=""https://twitter.com/Reddy/status/257807878658859008"">could not reach him</a> before they announced the award. While more theoretical than Roth?s work, Shapley?s research has also focused on using game theory to resolve situations in ways that benefit all parties. He received his Ph.D in mathematics from Princeton in 1953, when the founders of game theory, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, were on the faculty there and at the nearby Institute for Advanced Study. Robert Aumann, a game theorist, frequent coauthor of Shapley?s and corecipient of the 2005 Nobel prize in economics, <a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2005/aumann-lecture.pdf"" target=""_blank"">said</a> in his Nobel lecture that he considers Shapley ?the greatest game theorist of all time.?</p> <p>Shapley is perhaps best known for the ?Shapley value,? which refers to the cumulative benefits reaped by all participants in a game in which participants are cooperating rather than competing. One case where such a value is important is in designing matches like those that Roth specializes in; indeed, Roth <a href=""http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/88002983.pdf"" target=""_blank"">contributed a chapter</a> to a book in Shapley?s honor which explains what Shapley values are in more detail.</p> <p>He is also notable for having solved, with David Gale, the ?stable marriage problem?: that of pairing a certain number of men and women, each of whom have ranked the members of the opposite sex, such that there is no partner with whom anyone would rather be than the one with whom they are paired. Berkeley has a fun <a href=""http://mathsite.math.berkeley.edu/smp/smp.html"">Web game</a> that explores the problem in more detail. This case can also be generalized to apply to other situations where one needs to pair two people, or a person and an institution, such that both are satisfied. That includes cases like pairing medical students and hospitals, or public school students and schools ? exactly the sorts of situations in which Roth specializes.</p> <p>Adequately summarizing all of Shapley?s mathematical accomplishments would take several blog posts, but one other concept of his that has political and economic relevance is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley%E2%80%93Shubik_power_index"">?Shapley-Subik power index,?</a> which is used to determine which member of a decision-making body, such as a Congress or a parliament, holds the most power to determine outcomes. It often finds that members one wouldn?t expect to hold a huge amount of sway are actually the most important actors.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/247eff8e/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144545026145/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247eff8e/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144545026145/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247eff8e/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144545026145/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247eff8e/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

It filed a lawsuit late Friday with the New York State Supreme Court, alongside 11 other organizations, challenging the new regulation.</p> <p>This isn?t a first for New York City. When Mayor Mike Bloomberg proposed requiring all chain restaurants to post calorie labels, it went through<a href=""http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&#38;context=lawreview""> two years</a> of legal wrangling (partially over whether the regulation infringed on First Amendment free speech rights) before ultimately taking effect.</p> <p>The challenge to the large soda ban has less to do with substance, more to do with procedural issues. The plaintiffs argue that the the Board of Health, which voted to implement the ban, does not have the authority to do so. Rather, that authority sits with the New York City Council, the lawsuit argues. Here?s a key paragraph from the<a href=""http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/463325-soda-industry-v-new-york-city-petition.html""> lawsuit,</a> in which the soda ban is described as an ?executive fiat:?</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>Over the public objection of 17 members of the City Council, the legislative body elected by the people, the Board of Health has decided to tell the people of New York City how much of certain beverages they should drink. The City Council knows how to legislate; it has considered legislation on obesity and nutrition; and it has repeatedly rejected proposals to address those issues by targeting certain beverages.</p> <p>The Board of Health?s decision nonetheless to ban certain sizes of sweetened beverages in certain outlets, imposed by executive fiat, usurps the role of the City Council, violating core principles of democratic government, and ignoring the rights of the people of New York City to make their own choices.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>As the lawsuit points out, it likely would be a whole lot harder to move the soda ban through the City Council. Michael Grynbaum notes in the New York Times that some of its own members were <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/nyregion/soda-industry-sues-to-stop-bloombergs-sales-limits.html?_r=1"">circulating a petition</a> urging the Board of Health <em>not </em>to put the new regulation in place. Some of Bloomberg?s other, major public health initiatives ? <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-02/us/new.york.smoking.ban_1_state-beaches-and-parks-ban-smoking-bars-and-restaurants?_s=PM:US"">banning smoking in restaurants</a>, for example ? went through the City Council rather than the Board of Health.</p> <p>New York City argues that the Board of Health does indeed have the authority to create a regulation that promotes healthier living, which is the whole point of having a board of health. ?The Board of Health absolutely has the authority to regulate matters affecting health, and the obesity crisis killing nearly 6,000 New Yorkers a year ? and impacting the lives of thousands more ? unquestionably falls under its purview,? Bloomberg spokesman Marc La Vorgna <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/nyregion/soda-industry-sues-to-stop-bloombergs-sales-limits.html"">wrote</a> in a statement to the New York Times. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/247e1048/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144545016963/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247e1048/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144545016963/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247e1048/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144545016963/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/247e1048/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

We talked yesterday about Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan?s current and past proposals regarding the program, and where Diamond thinks we ought to go from here. A lightly edited transcript follows.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What do you make of the Romney campaign?s proposal to change the Social Security benefit formula for high earners?</strong> </p> <p>It?s an adjustment in the benefit formula for when you first claim benefits ? it?s not the cost of living adjustment after you?re retired. Currently the formula for initial benefits (when you start being eligible for benefits) goes up with the average wage index. Progressive price indexing (PPI) would substitute a mix of wage and price growth, depending on where you are in the earnings distribution. Romney hasn?t specified how many people are affected, but other plans using PPI lower benefits for 60 percent of workers, not just very high earners.</p> <p> <strong>Do you think there?s a responsible way to make a change like that?</strong> </p> <p>As an isolated question, there?s no good answer. As I said in the Bloomberg View <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-27/no-revenue-means-steep-social-security-cuts-under-romney.html"">op-ed</a> that Peter Orszag and I did on the Romney plan, the central question is how much you do with benefit cuts, and how much do you do with more revenue. Once you?ve sorted out an appropriate balance, the benefit cut portion could be PPI or an increase in the age for full benefits (Romney?s plan has both) or some other change. ? By the way, it drives me crazy when people talk about ?raising the retirement age.? Sometimes they mean the age for full benefits, which used to be 65 and sometimes they mean the age when you can first take benefits, which is 62, and sometimes they mean both.</p> <p>As a particular way of doing a portion of benefit decreases, neither PPI nor increasing the age for full benefits is my favorite but neither is horrific. The central point is, are you doing it all on benefit cuts or are you doing part with increased revenue? What Peter and I wrote on Bloomberg view was to describe the plan that was put forward by Senators Graham and Paul and Lee, which has exactly those two ingredients that Romney includes. But, each of the ingredients has parameters that can be tweaked so that the balance between the two could be anything you want, and Romney has not specified the details. The Senators? plan, which the Office of the Actuary evaluated, did three months a year of increase in the age for full benefits and then drops the rate of increase to one-half a month a year. You could start at two, you could drop at a different rate, etc. They run the increases rapidly for a while and then they slow it down. They tweak the two forms of benefit cut to come scantly ahead for actuarial balance for 75 years.</p> <p>What?s really interesting, to my mind, on this proposal is despite the fact that we?re an aging society, compared to today, they actually reduce the fraction of GDP spent on Social Security. I find that stunning ? a greater need but decreased spending relative to GDP. Again, you see that if you go to the <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/GrahamPaulLee_20110413.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Office of the Actuary website</a> and look at the figures relating to their plan. It?s a bit less than half a percent of GDP decrease at a time when we?re aging.</p> <p> <strong>Whereas if you kept benefits the same you?d expect the opposite.</strong> </p> <p>Right. You?d have the benefit level keeping pace and then the aging would require you to be increasing spending.</p> <p> <strong>What do you make of the criticism that raising the age for full Social Security benefits would disproportionately hit those at the bottom of the income scale, who haven?t seen life expectancy rise as much?</strong> </p> <p>It?s a mostly a red herring. Let me elaborate. The way I think about increasing the age for full benefits is that it has nothing to do with retirement. Maybe some people will retire later because it?s a signal in some form, but I?m skeptical that that matters a whole lot. People are thinking about different ages to retire and for any age that you retire there?s a smaller benefit if the age for full benefits is higher. So increasing the age for full benefits reduces the benefit level at any age at which you retire. You think of retiring at 62 now, you get an actuarial reduction of 25 percent from the current full benefit age of 66. If the age for full benefits is 70 the benefit is lower ? a 45 percent reduction. Instead of 75 percent of full benefits, you get 55 percent. So it?s a particular way of cutting benefits for people retiring at different ages.</p> <p>What I don?t like about it is that while it?s fairly close to a uniform across-the-board cut the way benefit reductions for early benefit claiming is structured, it isn?t <em>exactly</em> that and if you look at it, it?s a bigger benefit cut to people retiring at 62.</p> <p>What do we know about the people who retire at 62? On average, shorter life expectancy and lower earnings than people retiring at later ages. If anyone stood up and said, ?Instead of doing uniform across the board cuts, let?s make them a little worse for people who have shorter life expectancies and lower earnings,? they?d be laughed at. Anything that reduces benefits is going to hurt everybody. It?s going to hit people with short life expectancies, it?s going to hit people with high life expectancies. But we should not make it worse for those retiring earliest.</p> <p>It?s interesting, the issue of whether phrasing it as a benefit cut or a retirement age increase plays better. And I don?t know, I?m not a politician, but back in 83 there was a clear sense that increasing the age for full benefits  was thought to play better.</p> <p>Now, if you change the age for initial benefits, age 62, that has a differential impact because the people who can?t claim at 62 and would have done so have lost a year of benefits, and that?s a year relative to what their life expectancy is. That hits people particularly with short life expectancies.</p> <p> <strong>Do policies like the payroll tax cut concern you, in terms of financing Social Security?</strong> </p> <p>No. That required the Treasury to provide the revenue as if the cut wasn?t there. It?s a particular way of cutting general revenues. It has nothing to do with the actuarial balance.</p> <p> <strong>Right, but as a precedent does it concern you, or do you think any future cuts will happen the same way?</strong> </p> <p>It hasn?t worried me. I don?t know that anyone posed the question to me before. It has a lot of appeal as a temporary tax cut approach. So I don?t know that it really worries me.</p> <p> <strong>Ryan seemed to back off privatization in the debate?</strong> </p> <p>No, he has just said Romney?s the president and sets the policy. I wouldn?t call that backing off privatization.</p> <p> <strong>Fair enough. But looking back at his privatization proposals, one potential problem that arises is that many more people would be buying stocks, which could increase their prices and cause all kinds of disruptions. Does that worry you?</strong> </p> <p>I?ve always focused on the other side of it. Basically what we?re talking about is individual accounts that come out of existing payroll tax revenues. What?s happening is that the federal government is losing revenues, and to cover that there?ll be a lot more federal borrowing. They?re basically lending money that is borrowed from the public to individuals who then turn around and buy stocks and corporate bonds with it. I refer to it as lending because in all of these plans you give up some of your future benefits.</p> <p>The federal government has a cash flow problem, and you worry about the debt held by the public because it needs to be rolled over unlike debt held by Social Security. It is the need to roll over debt which leads to the sort of thing we?re seeing in Greece or Spain (though I don?t think that?s likely in the US anytime soon), it adds to that problem. I worry about the debt held by the public, which is more salient and makes the situation more risky than the question you raise, which is to what extent it raises stock prices and so lowers returns.</p> <p>Remember two things. It?s a slowly phased in operation. There are people who will be buying the additional federal debt, and in part this would be coming out of their buying less in stocks. The first pass cut at it is if we thought about this in a representative agent way, where the representative agent integrates the portfolio inside and outside, it?d be a wash. We don?t live in that world, obviously. At least half of the payroll taxpayers have no stocks, they don?t buy stocks. So that?s new demand. I think the portfolio change by people who do hold stocks would be a large part of the response.</p> <p>I haven?t thought of the rate of return issue being a big one. I think the rate of returns on stocks is driven by the rate of return on capital and that depends on the rate of aggregate savings. Maybe you get a little lower return on capital. I don?t see that as a big effect. And if it comes from higher investment, that is valuable.</p> <p>But let?s circle back to the Ryan plans. The <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/12/ryan-supported-social-security-privatization-in-2005-what-was-that-again/"">Ryan-Sununu</a> plan was in 2005. Ryan did a <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/02/rep_paul_ryans_daring_budget_p.html"">new plan</a> all by himself in 2010. The borrowing from the public was still there but greatly reduced because of changes in the plan. The Ryan-Sununu plan?s impact on borrowing from the public was astonishing. There?s a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&#38;id=497"">study</a> of all the different plans around in 2005, and it asked the question, ?How much does it impact debt held by the public in 2050.?</p> <p>And the Ryan-Sununu plan increased the debt held by the public by more than 90 percent of GDP. All of the individual account plans that were out there at the time required increases in the debt held by the public. It was only my plan with Peter Orszag, and <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/history/orals/balloralhistory.html"">Bob Ball?s</a> plan that decreased it. And of course we didn?t have individual accounts.</p> <p>I just don?t see him as moving away from privatization ? he said in the debate he still likes individual accounts. What fascinated me when I looked recently at Ryan?s 2010 plan, which I?d never done before, is that he wants to raise payroll taxes. But he does not increase the maximum subject to the payroll tax. And he doesn?t change the payroll tax rate. What he does is change the base that the payroll tax affects by including what?s now excluded from the payroll tax relating to health insurance benefits. It?s both what your employer spends for you and what?s currently not taxable when you spend it yourself through your employer. So he?s increasing the tax base, and he?s increasing revenues by a significant amount. 1.13 percent of payroll?s worth of increased revenues over 75 years.</p> <p>But the tax increase only applies up to the Social Security cap. So if you?re earning less than $110,000 and get your health insurance through your employer, your payroll tax payment goes up. If you earn more than $110,000, your payroll tax doesn?t go up. So this is a tax increase only for the bottom 94 percent, not the top six percent.</p> <p> <strong>And it isn?t a tax increase if you get your money from capital rather than wages.</strong> </p> <p>Right, but that would be true if you raised the payroll tax rate as well. Within the context of the traditional social security revenue stream, this Ryan plan is an increase in taxes for lower earners but not for higher earners.</p> <p> <strong>Another potential issue with these privatization plans is that most don?t let you pick and choose the stocks you invest in. You can pick from a menu of portfolios that the Social Security Administration puts together. Doesn?t that give administrators a lot of power over the stock market?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, potentially. But the basic idea is to imitate what?s done for federal civil servants. And so it?s broad index funds, and as such there?s very little scope for the organizers to tinker with it.</p> <p> <strong>So it?s not like you?re setting up the world?s biggest sovereign wealth fund.</strong> </p> <p>Exactly. When that first started for civil servants, it came back in along with the 1983 Social Security reform and kicked in in 1984. There were only three funds. There was, I think it was an S&#38;P 500 index fund, a corporate bond fund and a fund that just invested in US Treasuries. That was it. They?ve expanded it now. You can also buy some foreign stocks and the domestic stocks that are not in the S&#38;P 500, and you can have a lifecycle mix of these. The idea here is this is not managed money. Individuals still can adjust the stock-bond risk to adjust for their degree of. But it?s all done very broadly, not picking individual companies.</p> <p>The idea here is really to hold down, two things, to hold down the costs of running the system, and the second idea is to try to protect people from doing really dumb things.</p> <p> <strong>Last summer <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/94008/peter-diamond-social-security-benefit-tax-infrastructure"">you wrote a piece</a> for <em>The New Republic </em>calling for a grand bargain in which you pair long-term deficit reduction, in the form of fixing Social Security, with action to address the jobs crisis. Whoever?s elected, it seems probable that a debt deal of some kind will be enacted next year. Are you still as optimistic about the potential for a deal like that?</strong> </p> <p> <em>[Laughs]</em> I don?t know that I ever was optimistic. Let me frame this the way I think about these things. We have an unemployment crisis, in my view. The impacts, both on long-term unemployed and young people, are going to affect them for years and years. This is something we need to be addressing right away.</p> <p>We have a debt <em>problem</em>. We don?t have a debt <em>crisis</em>. If you look at CBO projections, and ask ?At what stage in the debt to GDP ratio do you think the debt market might start to look for a sovereign risk premium?? I think we have a decade at least, perhaps two before there?s even a hint of that problem. What we should be doing now is something that improves economic growth, and there?s a list of the usual suspects, and addressing the debt part should come into force slowly, although legislated soon. I?m obviously not alone in this. The same perspective is coming from Ben Bernanke and the IMF.</p> <p>So what can we do in terms of debt concerns that will have credibility that they really will happen, and represent good policy, not bad policies? Across the board spending cuts make bad policy. The answer to my mind is, let?s just fix Social Security because without individual accounts it has a big impact on debt held by the public. For example, my reform proposal with Peter Orszag knocked 20 percent of GDP from debt held by the public 45 years on. And restoring actuarial balance is something we need. As every Social Security analyst will tell you, the sooner you restore actuarial balance, the easier and fairer it is to do.</p> <p>Generally the political process has treated Social Security by itself and not as an integrated part of the budget process. In the 1990s, under Clinton, there was a budget rule that you couldn?t use Social Security to justify changes elsewhere in the budget. I really don?t like the idea that we might change the COLA for budgetary reasons. I think the analysis should focus on a whole package for Social Security. The countries that end up integrating their Social Security systems with their annual budget processes make a mess of it. We haven?t gotten into that kind of game.</p> <p>So I dislike integrating Social Security as part of a grand bargain <em>unless</em> you carve out a Social Security reform that restores actuarial balance, and does what has traditionally been our political approach.</p> <p>I can?t think of a better thing to be doing than Social Security precisely over its credibility. If we pass a fix, a bipartisan fix, it?s not going to be undone. Most of the other things that are on the table will stay on the table down the road and do not have the same credibility. It?s the ideal thing to be doing.</p> <p> <em>Update: This post has been amended at Diamond?s request to clarify some statements.

But in the end, winning the election is up to the presidential candidate, not the vice presidential candidate.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/09/obama-inauguration.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>The next presidential debate is Tuesday, and the advice President Obama is getting is largely stylistic. Attack more. Look less sleepy. Stop writing in your diary while Mitt Romney is talking.</p> <p>That Obama lost the first debate because he didn?t seem sufficiently psyched to be there is probably partially true, but it?s also a form of flattery. It says, in effect, that Obama?s only problem was the superficiality of the format and Mitt Romney?s untruths. Obama was just too deep and too thoughtful and too honest to win.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Obama buys into it. ?I do think that on television it was clear that I was being too restrained when Mr. Romney was telling his tall tales,? he <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/obama-if-people-read-transcript-theyll-think-i-won-last-debate/article/2510639#.UHq9yvlERCA"">told</a> a Miami radio host. ?But the truth is, when you read the transcript, everything I said was true and a lot of what he said was not.?</p> <p>But when I went back and read the transcript ? thus removing appearance and tone and body language from the equation altogether ? it was clear that Obama had lost the debate at least partly because he didn?t know what he wanted to say.</p> <p>At this point, Romney and Obama are running almost perfectly opposite campaigns. Romney can tell you exactly what he wants to do, but barely a word about how he?ll do it. Obama can?t describe what he wants to achieve, but he can tell you everything about how he?ll get it done. It?s a campaign without real policies against a campaign lacking a clear vision.</p> <p>For Obama, this is a striking change. His 2008 campaign was all bold vision and grand plans. He wanted to change Washington and pass a universal health-care plan by the end of his first term. He pushed a cap-and-trade plan to slow carbon emissions and promised immigration reform, an end to the war in Iraq and a post-partisan era that would both reignite citizen control over government and make them proud of the results.</p> <p>To his credit, Obama actually achieved crucial elements of his agenda ? health-care reform and an end to the war in Iraq, to name two. But the economy remains too weak, and Washington too divided and dysfunctional, for voters to feel Obama made good on his 2008 promises.</p> <p>One recurring problem for presidential candidates is that they don?t know how much they can?t do, so they overpromise. This happened to Obama in 2008. The problem for presidents is the reverse: Knowing exactly how much they can?t do and fearful of again overpromising, they lose the ability to inspire. This is happening to Obama now.</p> <p>Obama campaign officials insist that they have an agenda. They want to create a million new manufacturing jobs, hire 100,000 new math and science teachers, and require the rich to pay a bit more in taxes to protect our most important public investments.</p> <p>Sorry, but I don?t buy it. The guy who ran in 2008 to change, well, almost everything, isn?t enduring the grind of another presidential campaign to give the manufacturing sector a modest push. Obama hasn?t forgotten his more ambitious goals on climate change or campaign finance reform or the American Jobs Act. He has just stopped mentioning them.</p> <p>Obama strategists think the American people are done with sweeping promises and transformative rhetoric. Voters are willing to believe Obama couldn?t have gotten much more done given the state of the economy and the intransigence of the Republicans, but they?re not willing to believe that a second term will somehow redeem the high hopes of the first. Obama has to run a more humble campaign, his strategists contend, because he must show that he has been tempered by experience and realism.</p> <p>What makes this desultory political posture so depressing is that behind the soft reliance on lower expectations lie detailed, serious policy ideas worthy of a great campaign.</p> <p>Obama?s American Jobs Act is still the best ? and <a href=""http://washingtonexaminer.com/obama-if-people-read-transcript-theyll-think-i-won-last-debate/article/2510639#.UHq9yvlERCA"">most detailed</a> ? plan on the table to create jobs. His health-care law, which will begin in earnest in 2014 assuming Obama is reelected, will cover tens of millions of Americans and transform the delivery of medical care. Indeed, just this month, the law <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/01/for-hospitals-health-reform-starts-today/"">began linking</a> Medicare hospital payments to value rather than volume, and penalizing hospitals with high numbers of preventable readmissions. It?s a huge accomplishment, but not one you?ll hear Obama mention on the campaign trail. When Obama gets specific about policies these days, it?s usually about Romney?s plans, not his own.</p> <p>Conversely, Romney?s campaign agenda appears huge. He wants root-and-branch reform of the tax code, including a 20 percent across-the-board cut to marginal tax rates. He wants to reduce federal spending to 20 percent of gross domestic product and balance the budget. He wants to convert Medicare to a voucher program, make Medicaid a block-grant program, and repeal the health-care law and hand responsibility to the states.</p> <p>Ask how he intends to achieve any of this and the answers grow fuzzy. Romney will pay for his tax cuts and hold the burden steady on the rich by closing tax breaks that he won?t name and that the best independent analyses have concluded don?t exist in sufficient amounts to pay for the plan. Ask where he?ll make his vast budget cuts ? his plan implies a 40 percent cut to everything other than Medicare, Social Security and defense ? and Romney says he?ll cut tiny PBS. Ask how fast his Medicare vouchers will grow and he says he hasn?t decided. Ask how Medicaid recipients will survive his huge cut and he says the states will do more with less. Ask how he?ll replace Obama?s health-care law and he says that states should emulate Massachusetts, even though Massachusetts relied heavily on Medicaid funds that Romney has vowed to cut.</p> <p>This dearth of policy detail, however, is accompanied by a genuine vision about the kind of government we need, which problems it should try to solve and the general approach Romney would take in addressing them.</p> <p>Romney prevailed in last week?s debate in part because his vision filled the stage. Reading Obama?s answers, it?s startling how many of them are about Romney. On the heels of a workmanlike convention speech that was particularly lacking in what used to be called ?<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_thing"">the vision thing</a>,? his debate performance speaks of a deeper problem. Obama, at the moment, doesn?t have anything particularly inspiring to say.</p> <p>It might be that polls and focus groups have given the Obama campaign reason to retreat from presenting a bold agenda for a second term.

Flying has gotten dramatically cheaper since the airline industry was deregulated in 1978. Proponents of deregulation say that?s because there?s more competition and the Civil Aeronautics Board is no longer determining routes and setting fees. Skeptics <a href=""http://lbo-news.com/2012/06/04/airline-dereg-more-a-failure-than-matt-yglesias-says/"">will counter</a> that fares were dropping before deregulation and would have likely kept dropping anyway (thanks to technological improvements and the like).</p> <p>? One reason that flying is getting cheaper, Perry notes, is that airlines have gotten much better at making more efficient use of their planes. In the 1970s, the average flight was about 60 percent full. By 2001, the average flight was about 70 percent full. In the past three years, the average flight was about 80 percent full. ?That probably helps explain,? Perry notes, ?why the flying experience is less pleasant today than in the past.?</p> <p>? Oil matters here. Since 2005, airfares have begun to nudge upward again ? the same period in which oil has been getting scarcer and more expensive worldwide. But airfares don?t move in perfect lockstep with crude prices. The price of oil rose roughly 50 percent from 2009 to 2011 but airfares increased just 13 percent. Instead, fuel costs <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303665904577451621782709492.html"">have been eating into</a> airline profits.</p> <p>? Speaking of which, it?s still not very profitable to run an airline. Since 1979, the airline industry as a whole <a href=""http://www.airlines.org/Pages/Annual-Results-U.S.-Airlines.aspx"">has lost $37.7 billion</a>. Perry notes that the industry has lost money in seven of the past 11 years. The one exception is Southwest, which has turned a profit for 39 straight years ? <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/business/operations/2012/06/southwest_airlines_profitability_how_the_company_uses_operations_theory_to_fuel_its_success_.html"">here?s an explainer</a> from Seth Stevenson* on how they managed that.</p> <p>? Baggage and reservation change fees have been soaring in recent years, but flying is still cheaper than it was a decade ago, on average. Perry notes that baggage and change fees averaged $21.77 per flight last year, but the average domestic round-trip flight is still cheaper than it was in the 1990s.</p> <p>? Note that this chart just looks at the <em>average</em> round-trip domestic flight. There?s a fair bit of variation around the country. Some mid-sized cities such as Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Memphis have seen airlines scale back operations or close hubs, which has driven up airfares to and from those cities quite a bit.

A team of researchers at the University of Rochester <a href=""http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/ckidd/papers/KiddPalmeriAslin2012_Cognition.pdf"" target=""_blank"">revisited</a> the marshmallow experiment. And what they found was that the ability to delay gratification isn?t just a hardwired, innate skill. Quite the opposite. Behavioral cues play a big role in determining who holds out for that second marshmallow, and the results call into question how much self-control actually has to do with it.</p> <p>The Rochester researchers once again got a bunch of kids into a room. But they did something a bit different. Right before giving the kid a marshmallow, they would have an encounter with an adult. One would be unreliable; he would promise a bunch of fun art supplies that would never appear. Another would be reliable, delivering the art supplies as promised.</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/marshmallow.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/marshmallow-194x300.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>That earlier encounter had a huge influence on kids? willingness to wait for a second marshmallow. Only one of the 14 children in the unreliable condition held out for the full 15-minute wait. They may have assumed that the second marshmallow, just like the art supplies, was a big lie. More than half of the kids who had just had a reliable encounter, however, made it through the 15-minute wait.</p> <p>?The results of our study indicate that young children?s performance on sustained delay-of-gratification tasks can be strongly influenced by rational decision-making processes,? the researchers conclude. </p> <p>In other words, sometimes eating the first marshmallow is actually the more rational approach, based on what the child knows about the situation. Why should an adult who failed to provide promised art supplies, after all, be relied on to deliver a second marshmallow?</p> <p>?Being able to delay gratification ? in this case to wait 15 difficult minutes to earn a second marshmallow ? not only reflects a child?s capacity for self-control, it also reflects their belief about the practicality of waiting,? says Celeste Kidd, a doctoral candidate in brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester and lead author on the study. ?Delaying gratification is only the rational choice <em>if </em>the child believes a second marshmallow is likely to be delivered after a reasonably short delay.? </p> <p>The researchers contend that this could be true on a larger scale. If a child or adult lives in an environment where promises always get broken and outcomes are unreliable, the most rational response is to eat the marshmallow right in front of her ? and not wait for the promised marshmallows of the future.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/24703012/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544925222/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24703012/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544925222/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24703012/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544925222/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/24703012/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

It is to the tax code what the CBO is to the budget: a nonpartisan, impartial arbiter that produces respected estimates of revenues and other figures important to tax policy.</p> <p>So it?s a big deal that they sent Sens. Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch ? the chair and ranking member, respectively, on the Senate Finance Committee ? a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/BN_101212_192832.pdf"" target=""_blank"">letter</a> (obtained first by <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-12/repealing-deductions-pays-for-4-tax-cuts-study-says.html"">Bloomberg</a>) arguing that even if you eliminated almost every tax deduction in the books, you could only afford to cut tax rates by 4 percent before you start adding to the deficit. The full letter is here:</p> <p></p> <p>The paper recounts an experiment conducted by the JCT. They supposed that all itemized deductions ? things like the charitable deduction, the mortgage-interest break, etc. ? were eliminated (though not non-deduction tax breaks ? more on that later), along with the Alternative Minimum Tax. That mirrors Romney?s desire to cut tax breaks and eliminate the AMT. They also assumed that state and local bonds? interest would start to be taxed, which, as AEI?s Matt Jensen has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/27/wonkblogs-comprehensive-guide-to-the-debate-over-romneys-tax-plan/"">pointed out</a>, makes it easier for the Romney plan to add up.</p> <p>Finally, JCT assumed that capital gains and other investment income would be taxed at the same rate as regular income, instead of the preferential rates they currently enjoy. That?s a big difference from Romney?s plan, which proposes eliminating capital gains and other investment taxes for people making less than $200,000, but mirrors the Bowles-Simpson, Domenici-Rivlin and Wyden-Coats <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/19/tax-reform-is-likely-to-grow-the-47-percent/"">tax reform plans</a>, all of which remove the capital preference.</p> <p>Then JCT asked how low you could cut tax rates under this scenario without increasing the deficit, on net. The answer: not much at all. To keep revenue the same as it?ll be next year, when the Bush tax cuts expire, you could only cut rates by 4 percent. Instead of brackets of 15 percent, 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent, you?d have brackets of 14.4 percent, 26.88 percent, 29.76 percent, 34.56 percent and 38.02 percent. That?s not exactly revolutionary, and it?s a far cry from the 20 percent cut that Romney wants.</p> <p>That said, the change is very progressive. People making $10-20,000 a year get their taxes cut by 2.4 percent of income, a 61.4 percent cut relative to their previous burden. By contrast, millionaires see taxes go up 7.1 percent, or 5.5 percent of income:</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/jct_experiment.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/jct_experiment.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>It?s hard to draw conclusions about Romney?s or any other real-world plan from the JCT study. For one thing, it didn?t eliminate the health insurance or retirement income exemptions, judging that too difficult to model, nor did it cut the Child Tax Credit or Earned Income Tax Credit. Those were on the chopping block in the Tax Policy Center study on the Romney plan, and JCT doesn?t only exempt them from cuts in its experiment, it assumes that the expansions of them in the stimulus package and the Bush tax cuts will be made permanent.</p> <p>Most jarringly, the 4 percent cut is calculated relative to a baseline where almost all the Bush tax cuts expire, rather than the policies in effect today. Romney, by contrast, wants a 20 percent cut relative to the Bush rates, and given that few expect the Bush tax cuts will lapse in their entirety, the relevance of the baseline JCT uses is questionable. But the baseline if anything makes the study too optimistic. Deductions are worth more when tax rates are higher, so you could generate less revenue from cutting them if you used a baseline with the lower, Bush-era rates. So the same study with a more appropriate baseline would come up with even more modest rate cuts.<em> Update ? also worth noting that the current policy baseline means the JCT plan wouldn?t have to pay for things like the EITC expansion in the stimulus or patching/eliminating the AMT, so the effect is more ambiguous. Thanks to Marc Goldwein at Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget for pointing this out.</em> </p> <p>That said, the JCT study does drive home one lesson that the discussion of the Romney tax plan taught us: Base-broadening tax reform is really hard. Even if you get rid of popular deductions like the one for mortgage interest, and even if you jack up taxes on investment income, you can?t cut rates by all that much. No matter who wins next month, they have a herculean task before them on taxes.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/246c24cd/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544899143/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c24cd/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544899143/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c24cd/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544899143/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c24cd/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

The IMF?s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, <a href=""http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/10/09/1199151/its-austerity-multiplier-failure/"">explained </a>that recent efforts among wealthy countries to shrink their deficits ? through tax hikes and spending cuts ? have been causing far more economic damage than experts had assumed.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/02/16/Foreign/Images/2012-02-07T203324Z_01_SVP07_RTRIDSP_3_SPAIN.jpg"" /> </p> </p> <p>How did the IMF figure this? That was the tricky part. Blanchard could have just plotted <a href=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/10/11/opinion/101112krugman1/101112krugman1-blog480.jpg"">a simple graph</a> showing that countries undertaking heavy austerity measures, such as Greece and Portugal, are faring more poorly than their peers. But that doesn?t actually prove anything?perhaps those countries are undertaking austerity because they?d run into economic trouble. </p> <p>So, instead, Blanchard did something more subtle. He studied the IMF?s previous economic forecasts. If a country is already struggling for other reasons, the forecasters are likely to have taken that into account. And what Blanchard found was surprising: IMF forecasts have been consistently too optimistic for countries that pursued large austerity programs. This suggests that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage to those economies than policymakers expected. (Conversely, countries that engaged in stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected.)</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/blog_imf_austerity_forecast.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/blog_imf_austerity_forecast.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a> </p> <p>This all comes down to a long-standing debate over what?s known as the ?fiscal multiplier.? Economists tend to agree that tax increases and spending cuts hurt growth. The question is <em>how much</em> they hurt growth?a variable that usually changes at different points in time.</p> <p>This matters a lot for policy. If tax hikes and spending cuts only hurt growth a little bit, then a government with debt problems will want to enact some austerity measures. If a tax increase, on average, raises $10 in revenue but reduces output by $6, that might be painful, but it will ultimately shrink the deficit. (Indeed, those are basically the numbers that policymakers in Britain and elsewhere had been using.)</p> <p>But if tax hikes and spending cuts hamper growth significantly, then austerity could be ill-advised. Indeed, if the fiscal multiplier is really, really high in certain situations?such as during a downturn?then austerity could prove counterproductive. Those higher taxes and severe spending cuts will cripple growth so much that the nation will end up with an even bigger deficit than it started out with.</p> <p>Blanchard is now arguing that the fiscal multiplier appears to have been much higher over the past few years than policymakers, including the IMF, had assumed. It?s not 0.6. It?s somewhere between 0.9 or 1.7. If true, then countries in Europe and the United States should have been pursuing stimulus measures to boost growth?and not insisting on budget cuts. (Not surprisingly, Paul Krugman <a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/a-tragic-vindication/"">is claiming</a> vindication, since this was his view all along.)</p> <p>Yet it?s worth noting that not everyone is convinced by the IMF?s results. Over at the Financial Times, Chris Giles <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/85a0c6c2-1476-11e2-8cf2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28w3Qy7Jf"">tried to replicate</a> Blanchard?s calculations and found that the analysis was heavily skewed by Greece and Germany. That is, austerity appears to have kneecapped Greece much more forcefully than anyone expected over the past few years. And Germany seemed to get an exceptional boost from its stimulus programs. But if you remove those two countries from the equation (maybe they?re special cases), the results are murkier:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>For the countries where the full data is available on the IMF website, the results lose statistical significance if Greece and Germany are excluded.</p> <p>Moreover, the IMF results are presented as general but are limited to the specific time period chosen. The 2010 forecasts of deficits are not good predictors of errors in growth forecasts for 2010 or 2011 when the years are analysed individually. Its 2011 forecasts are not good predictors of anything.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p>So there are some caveats here. Fiscal multipliers can change over time, depending on the situation. Keynesians have often said as much: Stimulus is a good idea when the economy is weak, but the returns diminish when the nation is at full employment. Similarly, as Blanchard notes, economists still need a much better understanding of when, exactly, stimulus is effective and when austerity can help shrink the deficit. How does monetary policy factor in? Does the price of oil and other commodities matter? And so on. </p> <p>For now, though, as both <a href=""http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/10/09/1199151/its-austerity-multiplier-failure/"">Kate McKenzie</a> and <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/09/fiscal_multiplier_imf_s_blanchard_says_it_s_higher_than_we_thought_.html"">Matt Yglesias</a> point out, it?s quite significant that the IMF has shifted its stance on austerity so dramatically. In the 1990s, the fund was famous (or infamous, if you prefer) for ordering countries with debt troubles to tighten their belts. But now the IMF is urging countries in the euro zone, such as Netherlands and France, to loosen up a bit. True, those countries do have high debts. But with Europe still facing weak growth, budget-cutting might not be the answer just yet. For the IMF, that?s a big change in attitude.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/246c1079/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544833132/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c1079/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544833132/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c1079/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544833132/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c1079/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

These are the years when he <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&#38;id=222"">authored</a> a Social Security privatization plan that was so costly the Bush administration dismissed it as ?<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB110496995612018199,00.html"">irresponsible</a>.? These were the years in which Ryan voted for trillions of dollars in tax cuts and wars and Medicare drug benefits without demanding any way to pay for any of them. If a policy even arguably pointed in a conservative direction, he was an ?aye? vote, no matter how extreme, or how fiscally irresponsible.</p> <p> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/wonk0831.jpg""> <br /> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/08/wonk0831.jpg"" /> </p> <br /> </a>Then came the Obama years, in which Ryan remade himself as a conservative who cared only about deficits. The general thrust of his policies didn?t much change, but now he promised to pay for everything, and condemned his party for its profligate past. It?s during this period that Ryan began moving his suite of conservative reforms ? privatizing Social Security, block granting Medicaid, voucherizing Medicare, individualizing health care, investor-friendly tax reform ? into<a href=""http://roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/""> the broader framework of ?Roadmap? budgets</a>, which allowed them to be analyzed not so much as individual policies, but as contributors to deficit reduction.</p> <p>This was a crucial insight for him. Deficit reduction occupies an unusual and special role in the Washington conversation. There are a lot of things you can do under the guise of deficit reduction that would be considered almost unspeakably extreme if you proposed them on their own. Devolving Medicare into capped vouchers feeding into private plans, for instance, would typically get you labeled a conservative radical. But if you?re doing it to reduce the deficit, then it?s making ?hard choices.?</p> <p>It?s during the Obama years that Ryan really became a leader in the Republican Party, but becoming a leader in the Republican Party came with certain compromises. Social Security privatization, for instance, was a bridge too far for the GOP, so though that appeared in Ryan?s 2010 Roadmap, it was jettisoned in his 2011 budget. Similarly, offering specific health-care reforms began to look like a distraction in the fight against Obamacare, and so those were tossed overboard, too.</p> <p>But he was able to keep his plan to move Medicare to vouchers, to block grant Medicaid, and to rewrite the tax code, and by loading his budget up with strict (but vague) caps that promised huge long-term budget savings, he was able to build a reputation as one of fairly few politicians willing to make the tough sacrifices required for deficit reduction.</p> <p>And now we?re in the third Ryan era, which is his vice presidential campaign. That?s come with sacrifices so deep that they?re more like contradictions. Where his budget keeps Obama?s $716 billion in Medicare cuts, he?s now attacking the very idea that you would cut Medicare for current seniors. Where his health-care reforms ended the tax break for employer-based insurance, he?s now hammering Obamacare because the Congressional Budget Office says, in a worst-case scenario, that 20 million Americans might move from employer-based insurance to exchange-based insurance ? a small fraction of the transition Ryan was looking to trigger. Where he made his name being unusually specific about what and where to cut, he?s now defending Romney for being unusually vague on those topics.</p> <p>What?s been somewhat unusual about Ryan is that he?s managed to move from one era to the next without seeming to carry much baggage. Social Security privatization, for instance, is one of the most toxic ideas in American politics, but Ryan is rarely asked to answer for it, or even asked about it at all. Ryan?s record on the deficit was, in the Bush years, as bad as anyone in politics, but that hasn?t stopped him from building a reputation as a deficit hawk in the Obama years. Ryan?s plans violated a number of Romney?s policy promises, but that didn?t stop him from becoming Romney?s running mate.</p> <p>This isn?t necessarily a bad thing. Politicians should change their policies over time. The idea that legislators should be consistent over the decades, even as the world and our information about it changes, is an odd and probably damaging conceit. </p> <p>But Ryan?s past isn?t particularly distant. When he protests that his opponents are attacking him for a past iteration of his Medicare plan, he?s protesting them for attacking a policy he offered <a href=""http://cbo.gov/publication/22085"">last year</a>, not in 1992. It?s true that Ryan?s current set of policies is more moderate than his 2011 proposals, and that his 2011 proposals were different than his 2005 proposals, but there?s no evidence his underlying ideas have changed. It?s more that who he?d had to compromise with, and how he needs to present himself, have changed.</p> <p>An interesting thread in Thursday night?s debate was that Biden didn?t get trapped in the weeds of what Ryan supported when. Rather than argue about Ryan?s latest budget, he wrapped all of Ryan?s past and present ideas together and asked voters, who do you really think you can trust to preserve Medicare?</p> <p>This short-circuited Ryan?s typical rejoinder. Biden wasn?t arguing that Ryan?s 2004 Social Security privatization plan is in his 2012 budget, or that his 2011 Medicare plan is identical to Ryan-Wyden. He was simply saying that these were ideas Ryan had come up with quite recently, and voters should take them into account when considering whether to trust Ryan?s instincts on these programs.</p> <p>It was one of the debate?s more devastating moments, in large part because Ryan didn?t have a good answer for it. That?s something he and his team need to think about. Whatever happens in this election, if Ryan wants to be president in 2016 or 2020, he?s going to need to figure out how to explain his past ideas in a way that doesn?t threaten his present ambitions.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/246c1076/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544833131/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c1076/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544833131/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c1076/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544833131/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246c1076/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Here are five of the best reasons why the E.U. deserved it.</p> <p> <strong>1. But seriously, Germany hasn?t invaded France in over 70 years.</strong> </p> <p>Masket was joking, but there is good reason to believe that the E.U. contributed to the remarkable 70-year period of peace in Western Europe. No Western European country has gone to war with another since World War II, and the Balkans wars were the only wars on the continent as a whole in that period.</p> <p>Now, some of that is surely due to the Cold War uniting Western Europe in opposition to the Soviet Union. But that doesn?t explain all of it. As George Washington University?s Henry Farrell <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/12/does-the-eu-deserve-its-nobel-peace-prize/"">notes</a>, there?s good reason to think the E.U. played a key role in securing peace in Europe in the 1990s. Farrell points to a study by Thomas Diez, Stephan Stetter and Mathias Albert <a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&#38;aid=453922"">arguing</a> that the E.U. played a role in arbitrating border disputes in a nonviolent manner, as well as two studies, one by <a href=""http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/peace.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Farrell and Gregory Flynn</a> and another by <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3078657?uid=3739584&#38;uid=2&#38;uid=4&#38;uid=3739256&#38;sid=21101139459873"">Jeffrey Checkel</a>, arguing that the union?s membership requirements helped push former Soviet satellites and possessions toward democracy (more on why spreading democracy in that region helped peace later on).</p> <p>This all sounds intuitive today, but it wasn?t when the Soviet Union was collapsing. The University of Chicago?s John Mearsheimer, one of the most respected ?realist? international relations scholars currently working, wrote <a href=""http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/A0017.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a famous paper</a> in 1990 predicting that Europe was about to return to its old warlike ways. Appropriately titled ?Back to the Future,? the paper predicted that Germany, France, the U.K. and potentially Italy would become major powers, with Germany and the Soviet Union warring over control of Eastern Europe, and Hungary and Romania likely going to war. It suggested giving Germany nuclear weapons to deter such conflict; Mearsheimer later <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#38;rct=j&#38;q=&#38;esrc=s&#38;source=web&#38;cd=1&#38;cad=rja&#38;ved=0CCMQFjAA&#38;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmearsheimer.uchicago.edu%2Fpdfs%2FA0020.pdf&#38;ei=djp4UOefEMiU0QG494DgDQ&#38;usg=AFQjCNG20VuSLBQREjVlS02sNy7Xa7XvEg"">suggested</a> that Ukraine get them as well.</p> <p>The point being, it was not at all obvious in 1990 that Europe?s pattern of peace would last without the Soviet Union to unite against. And yet it did.</p> <p> <strong>2. It made the continent ? especially poor countries ? richer. And that stopped war.</strong> </p> <p>?Well, of course,? you might think. ?It?s a rich democratic region. Those don?t tend to be warzones.? That?s true, but in many ways Europe is as rich as it is because of the E.U. Starting with the European Coal and Steel Community, and later, the European Economic Community, the process of European integration dramatically reduced tariffs and other trade barriers between countries. As Berkeley?s Barry Eichengreen <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/EuropeanEconomicCommunity.html"">noted</a> in 1992, as the EEC was becoming the E.U., economists generally agree that regional integration like that can spur growth. Multiple<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292197000639"">recent</a> <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840600749524"">studies</a> have confirmed this, one of which <a href=""http://epub.wu.ac.at/170/1/document.pdf"" target=""_blank"">estimated</a> that per-capita income in E.U. member states would be one fifth lower without European integration.</p> <p>Another <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=304239"">found</a> that trade increased more among poorer ?periphery? states and between them and rich ?core? states than it did among the core states. That suggests that poorer, Eastern European members drew most of the economic benefit. A 2008 <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication14287_en.pdf"" target=""_blank"">paper</a> found that expansions of the E.U. in 2004 and 2007 greatly increased immigration from poor to rich countries, which helped growth in the continent as a whole.</p> <p>There?s a large amount of empirical literature, ably summarized by Columbia?s Erik Gartzke <a href=""http://dss.ucsd.edu/~egartzke/publications/gartzke_ajps_07.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, suggesting that better economic conditions prevent war. That?s intuitive, and the idea dates back to Kant?s ?Perpetual Peace.? For one thing, good economic conditions prevent ?diversionary wars? that states launch in an attempt to distract from bad economic conditions. As preposterous as it may sound, those wars do occur, with Argentina?s invasion of the Falklands during bad economic times <a href=""http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1992%20Diversionary%20Action%20Authoritarian.pdf"" target=""_blank"">a prime example</a>. In particular, Yale?s <a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&#38;aid=6181820"">Bruce Russett and Harry Bliss</a> found that trade between states greatly reduces the chance of war.</p> <p>Evidence suggesting that European integration has greatly increased per-capita income and trade between member states, then, suggests that it has also reduced the chance of war.</p> <p> <strong>3. It has spread democracy, and democracies don?t fight each other.</strong> </p> <p>This is a matter of some controversy, but there is widespread belief among international relations scholars in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reliable-Partners-Democracies-Separate-Peace/dp/0691122776"">?democratic peace.?</a> Democracies and dictatorships fight a lot, and dictatorships fight each other all the time, but it?s hard to single out a case of a democracy fighting another democracy.</p> <p>There are a few boundary cases ? such the Kargil war between Pakistan and India in 1999 (Pakistan was a democracy but not a strong one) and World War I (Germany and the U.K. both had powerful parliaments, though less for the former). But even conceding those, the likelihood of conflict between democracies is still much lower than between democracies and non-democracies or between dictatorships. In one of the most-quoted lines in all of international relations, Rutgers? Jack Levy <a href=""http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1988%20Domestic%20Politics%20&#38;%20War.pdf"" target=""_blank"">proclaimed</a> that the democratic peace ?comes as close as anything we have to an empirical law in international relations.?</p> <p>So if the literature that Henry Farrell mentioned (and contributed to) is correct, and the E.U. promoted democracy among ex-Soviet satellites and imperial possessions in Eastern Europe by requiring democratic practices as a prerequisite to membership,  then it in a small way contributed to peace in the region as well.</p> <p>Caveats are in order, though. Some argue that there haven?t been enough democracies in history to draw strong conclusions about the effect of democracy on states? behavior. What?s more, they claim that since the rise of democracy coincided with the Cold War, for which most democracies were on one side, one cannot conclude that democracies cause each other not to fight. But some, like John Oneal and Bruce Russett, have found <a href=""http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/faculty/hauser/PS591M/OnealRussettKantianPeaceWP1999.pdf"" target=""_blank"">statistically significant results</a> confirming a democratic peace even before the Cold War, blunting that criticism.</p> <p>In sum, I?m inclined to agree with Levy. The democratic peace is well enough established to credit institutions like the E.U. that promote democracy with reducing the probability of conflict, at least among its members.</p> <p> <strong>4. It started a process that will keep hurtling toward more integration.</strong> </p> <p>Georgetown?s Erik Voeten <a href=""http://www.olemiss.edu/courses/inst381/HoogheMarks04.pdf"" target=""_blank"">highlights</a> the work of the late Ernst Haas and other ?functionalists? who <a href=""http://www.lsu.edu/faculty/lray2/teaching/7971_1s2009/haas1961.pdf"" target=""_blank"">argued</a> that institutions promoting integration like the E.U. create spillover effects that in turn lead to yet more integration and so on. For example, the initial success of the European Coal and Steel Community lead to demands for economic integration in other areas, leading eventually to the European Economic Community. This implies that European integration has a momentum of its own, so trade and political integration will only grow.</p> <p>That means good things for peace. As shown above, trade between two countries greatly reduces the chances they?ll fight each other, so if Haas and functionalism are correct, then the benefits of European economic integration to peace will just keep growing. What?s more, the logical endpoint of the process described by Haas is a European super-state. There is a possibility of civil war within such a state, but if successful, it would effectively eliminate the possibility of war in Europe, just as the successful integration of the United States after the Civil War has lead to 150 years of peace within the country.</p> <p> <strong>5. It makes people think of themselves as Europeans.</strong> </p> <p>Voeten points to another study, by Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks at the University of North Carolina, which <a href=""http://www.olemiss.edu/courses/inst381/HoogheMarks04.pdf"" target=""_blank"">found</a> that Europeans who claim a ?strong national identity? are more, rather than less, likely to identify with the European project. That suggests that people are starting to include being European as part of their national identity, in addition to being French, German, Italian, etc. Jack Citrin and friend-of-Wonkblog John Sides have <a href=""http://home.gwu.edu/~jsides/morethan.pdf"" target=""_blank"">found</a> that the proportion of Europeans identifying with Europe, either exclusively or in addition to their home country, increased by 13 points in the 1990s.</p> <p>This kind of identification could decrease the propensity of Europeans to fight other Europeans, on the grounds that they share a common identity. Wars between actors who share a common identity do occur, as in the Palestinian civil war between Hamas and Fatah, but they?re much rarer than intergroup conflicts. So if more and more Europeans are thinking of themselves as Europeans as well as Frenchmen, Italians, etc., that could bode well for peace within the continent.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/246aadb1/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544826582/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246aadb1/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544826582/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246aadb1/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544826582/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246aadb1/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

No.","3","-1","0","","2012-10-12 17:19:34","<p>During his debate last night with Rep. Paul Ryan, Vice President Biden repeatedly underscored the Democratic position that Bush tax cuts for the rich should be allowed to expire. But his remarks suggested that the cutoff would be $1 million?significantly above the $250,000 threshold that President Obama and Democratic leaders have supported. Here?s his <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/12/transcript-the-2012-vp-debate/"">explanation</a>:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p>The middle class will pay less, and people making $1 million or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give you one concrete example. The continuation of the Bush tax cuts ? we are arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, $800 million ? billion ? of that goes to people making a minimum of $1 million.</p> </blockquote> </p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/10/biden-fists-300x208.jpeg"" /> </p> </p> <p>Biden?s remarks quickly set off <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-11/news/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-taxesbre89a1b4-20121011_1_tax-cuts-taxes-on-million-dollar-earners-tax-rates"">speculation</a> that the Obama administration might be shifting its policy position on the Bush tax cuts.</p> <p>Just a few months ago, Democrats like Sen. Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both supported a $1 million cut-off before <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/09/pelosi-schumer-abandon-tax-break-for-americans-earning-up-to-1-million/"">backing down</a>. That said, the $800 billion figure is typically cited as the cost of the Bush tax cuts for households above a threshold of $250,000, not the $1 million, suggesting that Biden may have simply misspoken.</p> <p>The Obama campaign says, however, that there is ?no change in tax policy, the VP was using $1 million as an example of who benefits from the extension of the Bush tax cuts over $250,000.? And that $800 billion figure? The campaign says the number Biden mentioned is the cost of the Bush individual tax cut combined with its estate tax break, as per the Tax Policy Center, and points out the total cost of the Bush tax breaks for those with incomes higher than $250,000, including the estate tax provision, is $968 billion.</p> <p>So the Obama campaign?s definition of the wealthy has stayed the same, Biden?s remarks notwithstanding. </p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/246aadb0/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544826581/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246aadb0/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544826581/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246aadb0/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544826581/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246aadb0/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

Remember the jobs crisis?","3","-1","0","","2012-10-12 16:07:46","<p>Does anyone remember we have a jobs crisis in this country?</p> <p>I ask because, having watched the two debates so far, I?ve not heard a word of serious hope for the unemployed. The jobs crisis has become, in politics, little more than an attack line. It?s something you reference because you have to, not because you have a serious plan to do anything about it.</p> <p> <p> <img src=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/09/jobs-sign-1-300x200.jpeg"" /> </p> </p> <p>Thursday night, moderator Martha Raddatz asked the two candidates, Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan whether they could guarantee unemployment would fall below 6 percent, and if so, by when?</p> <p>Biden, to his credit, refused to give a date. But he also refused to give a mechanism. He said things are getting better. He segued into a hit on Romney?s 47 percent comments. And then he started talking about the Bush tax cuts. He didn?t even mention the administration?s main jobs policy, the American Jobs Act.</p> <p>Ryan began by making a flatly untrue statement about unemployment. He said it?s risen from 8.5 percent to 10 percent in Biden?s hometown of Scranton, Pa., and that?s how it?s been all across the country. That?s just false. Unemployment has been coming down, and is now lower than it was during Obama?s first full month in office. Then we got the five-point plan:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p> <em>It?s a five-point plan. Get America energy independent in North America by the end of the decade. Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis.</em> </p> <p> <em>Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas, and champion small businesses. Don?t raise taxes on small businesses because they?re our job creators.</em> </p> </blockquote> </p> <p>There?s absolutely nothing in that plan that?s responsive to the ongoing jobs crisis. That?s true even if you think every single element of that plan is a brilliant long-term move for the economy. We didn?t suddenly become energy dependent in 2008, and our workers didn?t lose all their skills when Lehman collapsed. </p> <p>In both debates, taxes have taken up far more time than jobs plans, and for good reason: Both the Obama and Romney campaigns actually have tax plans. There?s something to argue over. At this point, they either don?t have a real jobs plan (Romney) or they?ve stopped pushing their jobs plan (Obama), and so there?s nothing for them to argue over.</p> <p>Back in January, I predicted this would happen. In a column on what would matter in the 2012 election, I <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/wonkbook-what-matters----and-what-doesnt----in-2012/2012/01/13/gIQA7lgpvP_blog.html"">wrote</a>:</p> <p> <blockquote> <p> <em> <strong>Taxes:</strong> The easy line is that this election is going to be about jobs. I think it?s going to be about taxes. Three reasons: First, because a big tax cut is at the core of Romney?s policies for how to create jobs and a big tax increase on the top two percent is at the core of Obama?s thinking on how to reduce inequality. Second, because the GOP?s top priority is tax cuts and the top priority among liberals right now is raising taxes on the rich. Third, because Republicans think they have a winning issue in painting Obama as a tax hiker and Democrats think they have a winning issue in painting Romney as George W. Bush 2.0. In other words, the two (likely) candidates? platforms, parties, and polling all push in the direction of emphasizing taxes very heavily.</em> </p> </blockquote> </p> <p>So I?m not surprised to see taxes dominating the discussion. But I wouldn?t have predicted ? I wouldn?t even have considered ? that the candidates would spend so little time talking about how to create jobs.</p><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636581/s/246a4a03/mf.gif"" width=""1"" /><br /><br /><a href=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544889415/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246a4a03/a2.htm""><img border=""0"" src=""http://da.feedsportal.com/r/144544889415/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246a4a03/a2.img"" /></a><img border=""0"" height=""1"" src=""http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/144544889415/u/57/f/636581/c/34656/s/246a4a03/a2t.img"" width=""1"" />"

But unlike many mainstream media reporters, she knows better than what she is fed by the Obama administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is partly why the Obama campaign has joined the Romney campaign in complaining to the Commission on Presidential Debates about recent statements that she would play an active role.</p>
<p>Crowley said <a href=""http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/14/moderator-role-under-scrutiny-before-the-debate/"">last week</a>: &ldquo;Once the table is kind of set by the town-hall questioner, there is then time for me to say, &lsquo;Hey, wait a second, what about X, Y, Z?&rsquo;&rdquo; In other words, she would pose challenging follow-up questions to the candidates after they had answered each question from the audience. Certainly moderators have done that in the past: in the GOP primary, the moderators routinely rephrased audience questions themselves.</p>
<p>For the second presidential debate, which will follow a town hall format, the campaigns had agreed to a more limited role for the moderator. The Romney campaign fears a more active moderator--for good reason: both of the previous moderators interrupted the Republican candidate more often and showed greater deference to the Democratic incumbents, with Martha Raddatz in particular <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/12/By-the-Numbers-Moderator-Raddatz-Attacked-Ryan-9-Times-Biden-Once"">attacking Paul Ryan&rsquo;s views</a> repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign does not fear Crowley&rsquo;s political views. It fears her knowledge of the facts. And the last thing it wants is someone knowledgeable fact-checking Obama onstage. (Imagine the disaster if Raddatz had done that with any one of Vice President Joe Biden&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/12/Fact-Check-Top-Ten-Worst-Lies-by-Joe-Biden-in-VP-Debate"">numerous misstatements of fact</a>.) Crowley has shown a tendency to do just that, even if she favors Obama&rsquo;s broad political and philosophical approach generally.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we saw both versions of Crowley on CNN&rsquo;s <em>State of the Union</em>. There was the liberal cheerleader, hyping an obscure poll that projected an implausible 2-point lead for Obama over Romney in Arizona, where even left-wing pollsters have given Romney a clear lead. Mike Flynn <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/14/media-hype-az-outlier-poll"">noted</a> that the pollster had vastly overestimated Latino voter turnout, ignoring its own evidence that they were the least likely to turn out of any group.</p>
<p>And then there was Crowley the fact-checker, contesting Robert Gibbs&rsquo;s false claim that Mitt Romney&rsquo;s initial statement on the 9/11 embassy attacks had referred to the attack in Benghazi. As Crowley correctly noted, Romney&rsquo;s statement focused on the Obama administration&rsquo;s response to the attack on the U.S. embassy in Cairo, in which both the embassy and the State Department had apologized for an obscure anti-Islam video.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign and its more pliant mainstream media allies would prefer that the public believe Romney was referring to the Benghazi attack alone, rather than reacting to the administration&rsquo;s weak response to the Cairo attack. (The State Department did react with outrage to the former, but offered abject apologies for the latter--apologies that were both disowned by, then essentially repeated by, the White House itself.)</p>
<p>The Candy Crowley that appears onstage at Hofstra University could very well shill for Obama. But if she does, and if she fails to ask &ldquo;about X, Y and Z&rdquo;--or asks Romney alone such questions--it will be because of a conscious choice, made under extreme pressure from the Obama campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She may be a liberal reporter, but she&rsquo;s a tough one regardless, and voters should hope she will remain so, for both sides, on Tuesday.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/neoJNMR1Q58"" width=""1"" />"

How?</p>
<p>In various neighborhoods around Cleveland, Cincinnati and Milwaukee, there are billboards reading, &ldquo;Voter Fraud is a Felony! Up to 3 &frac12; years and a $10,000 fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, of course, is true. But the Obama Rag is distraught that the billboards may discourage ineligible voters (most, if not all would be Obama voters, since the billboards are largely in black neighborhoods) from casting their illegal votes. The editorial page of the Rag reads: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">The appearance, mostly in Cleveland's predominantly black neighborhoods, of <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/10/politicians_say_advertisement.html"">billboards warning against voter fraud</a> is constitutionally <a href=""http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/10/washington_group_asks_for_clea.html"">protected speech</a>.</p>
<p>You mean it&rsquo;s legal? Oh. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">It is also insulting, demeaning, belittling speech -- coming from people who choose to remain anonymous -- and a despicable election tactic.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">The billboards, posted here and in Cincinnati and Milwaukee by what has been identified only as a private family foundation, insinuate that the neighborhoods in which they are found are hotbeds of voter fraud, which, of course, they are not.</p>
<p>The Rag is now deciding exactly what the billboards are insinuating. Of course, the Rag is impartial in these matters.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">The real point of these humiliating billboards is to intimidate voters in poor neighborhoods and to sow confusion.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s completely false. The billboards state the truth, which usually erases confusion. But the Rag is on a mission.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Critics want billboard owner Clear Channel Outdoor to remove the message. But Clear Channel has the right to sell its space as it sees fit, and it's subject to a contract. The contract includes an anonymity clause for the buyer -- a provision the company says it won't allow any longer. Good.</p>
<p>Oh, so now the right to constitutional free speech is restricted?</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">Residents of the neighborhoods where the fraud warning looms should be energized. A strong turnout at the polls would be the sweetest revenge -- and the loudest rejection of such ugly tactics.</p>
<p>The sweetest revenge for the Left is to persuade voters to commit voter fraud, cheat, and buck the system. And they accuse the Right of &ldquo;ugly tactics&rdquo; by telling people the truth?</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/8ViYZ-y4SJs"" width=""1"" />"

Zak watched the debate where Joe Biden was brilliant, Martha Raddatz was fair, and Paul Ryan was like ""the perp-of-the-week"" on an episode of TVs ""Law and Order: SVU."" That is exactly what he said on Twitter as he watched the debates.
</p>
<p>Zak must have thought he was brilliant with this Twitter observation: ""35 min in, Biden is Det. Olivia Benson and Ryan is the perp-of-the-week. #SpecialVeepsUnit,"" he tweeted.
</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with the TV show, each week it features yet another sex criminal ""perp"" that has attacked a little child, raped a woman, or murdered someone. The show is one long cavalcade of sickos, weirdos, and creeps chased by cops who imagine they are above the law employing the sort of shoddy police work that would lead them to be either fired or put in prison themselves.</p>
<p>That wasn't all Zak had to say about Ryan. He also characterized him as a child, Tweeting, ""My #VPdebate review coming soon: &lsquo;A man debated a boy Thursday night on national television, and both were ultimately schooled by a woman.&rsquo;""
</p>
<p>Zak's full piece in the Post was also <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/joe-biden-paul-ryan-duke-it-out-in-debate--and-get-schooled-by-martha-raddatz/2012/10/11/13c7ae18-13c1-11e2-bf18-a8a596df4bee_story.html"">oddly dismissive of Ryan</a>.
</p>
<p>But Zak's skewed interpretation of the VP debate does not measure up well against his Old Media colleagues whose Twitter streams revealed a different state of affairs.
</p>
<p>For one thing, not many of Zak's Old Media pals thought Biden was so wonderful, nor did they think he was acting like the adult in the room. In fact, just the opposite. Many members of the media were slamming Biden for being a smirking, laughing, arm waving, constantly interrupting jerk.
</p>
<p>Here are just a few tweets by other members of the media:

    <li><strong>Buzzfeed</strong>: Ben Smith @BuzzFeedBen So did Biden practice laughing at Ryan???
    </li>
    <li><strong>Townhall</strong>: Guy Benson @guypbenson Will Biden laugh his ass off at the terrible economy, too? #VPdebate
    </li>
    <li><strong>WhiteHousePressCorps</strong>: @whpresscorps RT @kirstenpowers10: Biden laughing while Martha talks about Iran getting the bomb is just weird.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wash. Examiner</strong>: Philip Klein @philipaklein If Biden's strategy was to come off like a complete jerk, he's succeeding brilliantly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>NBC News</strong>: Chuck Todd @chucktodd Biden is controlling the debate; but he's interrupting a lot; fine line on controlling a debate and being overly aggressive;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there were many voices criticizing Biden for his ignorant performance. The attack on Biden's smirking, laughing, and arm waving was all over Twitter, not that Zak seemed to have noticed.
</p>
<p>Worse, Biden appeared to have a particular goal in mind with his debatus interruptus style. Gregory nailed it saying on Twitter, ""My colleague @chrisdonovannbc wonders whether Biden is firing up the base more than reaching undecideds tonight. #NBCPolitics""
</p>
<p>With Biden having to make an attempt to fire up the base only weeks before the election, this would seem to auger badly for team Obama. One would think that by now the left-wing base would already be signed onto Obama's reelection. But if Biden had to make a play straight to the hardcore left and <em>ignore the moderates and undecideds</em>, well that appears to be very bad news for how the reelection campaign is going.
</p>
<p>As to those moderates and undecideds, CNN's flash polls during and right after the debate showed that <a href=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/11/cnn-poll-on-debate-winner-ryan-48-biden-44/?hpt=hp_t1"">Ryan had a slight edge</a> in nearly all categories. Twitchy also made note of that saying, ""CNN voter dials not friendly to VP Biden <a href=""http://twitchy.com/2012/10/11/cnn-voter-dials-not-friendly-to-vp-biden/?utm_source=autotweet&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=twitter"">http://bit.ly/Qgoksd</a>.""
</p>
<p>In other words, far from being ""brilliant,"" Biden's effort did nothing to help move the ball in favor of Obama. And Zak seems to have been one of the very few that didn't understand this fact.

A handful of libs sitting around a small table chatting about how best they can get Dear Leader elected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a week is about all of this anybody can take<em>.</em></p>
<p>Andrew Sullivan was one of the five (counting Matthews) lib panelists this week talking about President Barack Obama's debate failure, why it happened, and how he needs to fix it. His quote was one for the ages.</p>
<p>""I think that they (bad, evil Republicans) got into his (Obama's) head with all this racist stuff before the first debate, you know, the Hannity stuff, 'look there's a black guy running for office,' like two days before, I think he, he, he (has) repression of his own anger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""He (Obama) should be angry that these people (Romney, Ryan, and more bad, evil Republicans) have the gall to talk to him about the deficit and the gall to talk to him about foreign policy after their record.""</p>
<p>So, lets see here, so much to&nbsp;dissect&nbsp;with this one statement. Sean Hannity apparently just figured out two days before the recent Presidential Debate that Obama was black and he launched a racist attack at Obama (who apparently watches ""Hannity"") and that got into his head to the point that it messed him up during the debate. That makes perfect sense. Why not just blame the altitude?</p>
<p>The second half of the quote is even better. Sullivan calls himself a ""journalist"" but he doesn't want anybody attacking Dear Leader. Talking ""truth to power"" is now ""people have the gall to talk to him.""</p>
<p>Let's see here. Obama's deficits are five times greater than President George W. Bush's and Sullivan does not want Obama to be questioned about that. Obama's foreign policy is filled with lies (lies that the administration knew they were making at the time,) the Middle East is falling apart, and Sullivan doesn't want anybody to question Obama about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we're at it, the bigger question here, what are Romney's deficits and foreign policy failures? He has none. He has never been president. Sullivan think's Romney is George W. Bush. Please get some new glasses, Sullivan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which speaks to the essence of the Obama Campaign 2012. Sullivan exposed it. Obama is running on Bill Clinton's record and attacking George W. Bush. It's all he's got.</p>
<p>Forward.</p>

<p>After Bissinger, a life-long liberal,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/08/buzz-bissinger-why-i-m-voting-for-mitt-romney.html"">wrote</a>&nbsp;a column about why he has decided to vote for Mitt Romney this year, his liberal&nbsp;peers in the media&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/11/buzz-bissinger-on-being-savaged-by-the-liberal-media-after-backing-mitt-romney.html"">savaged</a>&nbsp;him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bissinger, who contributed $2,300 to the Obama campaign in 2008, said ""writers from national media outlets"" were ""trying to pick the column apart because they were outraged that one they considered part of the tribe, a journalist and author, would actually turn away from the ingrained liberal leanings of the profession"" and publicly support Romney.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""The column only confirmed for me the liberal bias that is rife in the mainstream media,"" Bissinger wrote. ""Every colleague but one vehemently disagreed with my support of Romney, and they are deceiving themselves if they think they can keep such political views out of their stories.""</p>
<p>In endorsing Romney, Bissinnger wrote it was ""the most difficult opinion piece of my life,"" but after Romney ""performed with stunning vigor and enthusiasm and President Obama performed with stunning aloofness and arrogance,"" Bissinger decided to vote for Romney this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bissinger wrote:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>As a lifelong Democrat from a family of lifelong Democrats, I noted repeatedly that the decision was anguished, difficult, emotional, but rooted in a sincere conviction that I could no longer back a president who no longer acted like he wanted to be president, who offered a vision for the country as original as those college essays you can buy off the Internet, who in front of 70 million viewers acted like he had 90 minutes to kill before going out to dinner with Michelle for their 20th anniversary. Coupled with Romney exuding a belief that this is a country that can still move forward, not backward. Coupled with Romney's return to the moderate he always was as Masschussetts governor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bissinger said he did not write the column to ""inflame"" and wrote the piece in a nuanced way to ""show that we have to move beyond the dangerous reactionary conviction where liberals believe there has never been a good conservative idea in the history of the Republic and conservatives believe there has never been a good liberal idea in the history of the Republic.&nbsp;""</p>
<p>""The response to the column, for me at least, is far more interesting than the column itself,"" Bissinger wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And on Sunday, the mainstream media--and Reuters, in particular--may have reached a new low by legitimizing a semi-scientific online poll with a whopping 10% margin of error that found Obama leading Romney by 28 points (59%-31%) among early voters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/14/obama-lead-early-voters-poll_n_1964493.html"">poll</a>&nbsp;has been splashed across the front page of websites like <em>The Huffington Post</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and has become a convenient way for the mainstream media to try to claim that Romney's lead over Obama, which has been stable for the better part of a week, does not matter because Obama has banked enough early votes to give him insurance against any lead Romney may have in the polls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poll is atrocious for many reasons. First, the poll apparently only surveyed a grand total of <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">11</span>&nbsp;13 voters from Ohio and <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">19</span>&nbsp;22 from Florida, two states that may be the most critical in determining the election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, instead of actually looking at the number of absentee ballots returned or early votes cast in the various swing states to obtain hard data, Reuters decided to conduct an online poll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mainstream organizations never report on ""online"" polls such as those done by Zogby Interactive. They usually ridicule, at worst, and caution, at best, polling outfits that do not even call cell phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, of course, the mainstream media conveniently make an exception when one of these semi-scientific online polls helps Obama during a period in which he desperately needs it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent days, mainstream polling organizations that the media consider gold standards--such as Pew Research and Gallup--have shown Romney with leads ranging from two to four points. Even&nbsp;Reuters/Ipsos's own daily tracking <a href=""http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5821"">poll</a> for Friday had Romney leading Obama nationally by one point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these numbers, the mainstream media does not have a national poll it can cite to help Obama, so Obama's media supporters are seizing on the Reuters result to help Obama's flailing campaign.</p>
<p>Reuters should be ashamed for trumpeting such a poll, but mainstream organizations who are hypocritically reporting on and legitimizing a poll they would have otherwise ignored are even more shameful.&nbsp;</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/y2mGY1v5AWQ"" width=""1"" />"

<blockquote>
<p>CROWLEY: We&rsquo;ve already had this debate. All they have to do at Obama Reelect is open up the files because this debate has already happened. They just bring it back, it goes, it is, you know, what they talk about. But I think the other thing that&rsquo;s worth pointing out is not every Republican has signed on to this kind of, I mean, they will publicly. But there is some trepidation&hellip;</p>
<p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN: They're afraid.</p>
<p>CROWLEY: ...<em>that this might be, looks a little bit like some sort of ticket death wish</em>. </p>

<p>This is the same woman who, when <a href=""http://www.mrctv.org/videos/crowley-softballs-durbin-incredulous-prospect-romney-victory"">interviewing</a> Dick Durbin and Lindsay Graham three weeks ago before the Romney surge, threw this softball to Durbin --</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because we are seeing polling indicating that in the battleground states, as well as nationwide, the president now seems ahead by an amount that is perceptible. As far as you are concerned, where are the biggest danger points for the president message wise or campaign wise as he moves forward?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then followed with this to Graham &ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Senator Graham, to you, why do you think Mitt Romney is struggling so much? We&rsquo;ve --&nbsp; we&rsquo;ve talked so much about the history of the numbers as relates to unemployment or anything else and how it would seem that President Obama would not be doing well, and yet Mitt Romney is the one who is struggling. Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Graham answered, &ldquo;Well, to be honest with you, I think if history holds here and undecided voters break against the incumbent, as they generally do, that this is a very close race. Quite frankly I like our positioning &ndash;</p>
<p>Crowley snidely interrupted, &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the same woman who <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2009-08-27/politics/kennedy.camelot_1_sen-kennedy-edward-moore-kennedy-ted-kennedy?_s=PM:POLITICSc"">eulogized</a> Kennedy by dismissing Mary Jo Kopechne like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's an imperfect story of an often reckless young man who lived hard and as a U.S. senator drove a car off a bridge after a party, killing a young campaign aide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imperfect story? And he didn&rsquo;t just kill her by driving off a bridge; Kennedy left her to suffocate to death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Senate was redemption. In the Senate, the dream came alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whose dream? Kopechne&rsquo;s?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Eventually, someone will fill the Senate seat of Edward Moore Kennedy, but there's pretty much universal agreement that nobody -- family or friend -- can take his place. </p>

<p>Guess who else <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/10/11/162754053/transcript-biden-ryan-vice-presidential-debate"">cut</a> the line out of their transcript? National Public Radio (NPR).&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s where it gets truly nefarious; the New York Times, NPR, the Chicago Sun Times and other news outlets used the same news source for the transcript: the Federal News Service (FNS). How many media outlets did the FNS use to mislead readers around the nation?</p>
<p>The Federal News Service was bought in 2010 by the Dolan Company, which published business journals, court and commercial newspapers and other publications, and then bought FNS, which, among other things, publishes transcripts of events like the debates.</p>
<p>Would a supposedly reputable company like FNS try to twist the truth in order to help one political party? You decide.</p>
<p>The CEO of the Dolan Company is James P. Dolan. Here is a <a href=""http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/james-dolan.asp?cycle=10"">list</a> of his political contributions for 2009- 2010. </p>
<p><strong>2009: </strong></p>
<p>$10,000 for the Follow the North Star Fund, a Minnesota Democratic PAC</p>
<p>$2400 for Tim Walz for Congress. Walz is a Democrat.</p>
<p><strong>2010:</strong></p>
<p>$10,000 Follow the North Star Fund</p>
<p>$5000 Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party</p>
<p>$2400 Friends for Harry Reid</p>
<p>$1400 Tim Walz for Congress</p>
<p>$1000 Klobachar for Minnesota. Klobachar is a Democrat.</p>
<p>$1000 Giffords for Congress. Giffords is a Democrat.</p>
<p>When Dolan bought FNS in 2010, he uttered these deathless <a href=""http://www.talkingbiznews.com/1/dolan-buys-fed-news-service/"">words</a>: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Fed News plays an important role in public affairs, reporting exactly what was said, rather than official transcripts that often show only what was supposed to have been said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is it hard to believe him now?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The Federal news Service has corrected itself, but few of the outlets have, including the New York Times. The damage has been done.<strong><br />

<p>A Getty representative speaking not for attribution told Breitbart the photographer did not speak with the man wearing the t-shirt and that he did not know with certainty the man was a Romney supporter. The representative did not know whether Getty would run a correction for the caption.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While liberals online pointed to the photograph as proof of racism among Romney supporters, conservatives wondered whether the man was a plant trying to make Romney look bad.</p>
<p>When Tea Party street activism was at its height, a movement called Crash the Tea Party was formed to infiltrate Tea Party rallies with liberal activists who would create bad optics for the Tea Party by acting out for the media liberal stereotypes of conservatives. Leftist infiltrators wearing Nazi symbols <a href=""http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2010/04/racist-leftist-infiltrators-driven-from-tea-party-rallies-video/"">have been driven out</a> of Tea Party events around the country in the past.

<p>The Romney campaign issued a statement to Kaczynski denouncing the t-shirt saying it was, &ldquo;reprehensible and has no place in this election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While BuzzFeed did not claim the man was a Romney supporter, it did not note the possibility the man could have been a liberal plant.</p>
<p>Huffington Post <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/13/romney-supporter-wears-put-the-white-back-in-the-white-house-campaign-event-ohio_n_1963583.html"">reported</a> on the photo Saturday morning with the headline &ldquo;Romney Supporter Wears 'Put The White Back In The White House' T-Shirt At Ohio Campaign Event (PHOTO).&rdquo; The Huffington Post article did not mention any effort to ascertain whether in fact the man was a Romney supporter.</p>
<p>Likewise, Global Grind&nbsp;<a href=""http://globalgrind.com/news/romney-supporter-racist-shirt-black-white-house-obama-ohio-photos"">repeated without question</a> the unproven allegation in its report on the photo: &rdquo;during a campaign event in Ohio this past Friday, one Romney supporter took it too far as he was spotted wearing a shirt that read &ldquo;Put The White Back In The White House.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The Huffington Post has been pushing the 'racist Romney supporter' meme on Twitter throughout the weekend.

Take the case of former Washington bureau chief for Yahoo! News, David Chalian. You may recall that he was fired after he was heard saying during the Republican National Convention that Republicans were ""happy to have a party with black people drowning."" He may have been fired from Yahoo! for this ignorant statement, but now he's been hired by Politico.
</p>
<p>You'll recall that the Republican convention started in the midst of a full-blown hurricane, a storm some feared would again swamp New Orleans. Of course the Old Media was filled with reminiscences of Hurricane Katrina. Worries for New Orleans' minorities was again everywhere. Speculation that the GOP would cancel its convention was also ubiquitous.
</p>
<p>The GOP did postpone its opening day, but decided not to cancel the whole show and this caused some left-wing tongues in the Old Media to start wagging that Republicans were <em>obviously</em> racist. Cue David Chalian who was <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/08/29/Shock-ABC-News-Romneys-Party-As-Black-People-Die"">heard on an open mic</a> perpetrating that very calumny.
</p>
<p>On August 28, while in an ABC control room, Chalian unleashed his hateful charge, saying: ""They&rsquo;re not concerned at all. They are happy to have a party with black people drowning.""
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>Yahoo! News fired Chalian almost immediately for that inflammatory remark, as well they should have.
</p>
<p>But now, <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/david-chalian-back-in-business-138292.html"">Politico has hired the disgraceful journo</a> to help expand its video operations.
</p>
<p>So, why hire a man that Politico knows ahead of time is hateful and bigoted and has admitted with his words and deeds that he is wholly sold out to one side of the political aisle and cannot be expected to be fair in his coverage of the news?
</p>
<p>He said he's sorry. See? Problem solved.
</p>
<p>Politico Editor-in-Chief John Harris admits that he was informed ahead of time about Chalian's bias, but it won't be a problem.
</p>
<blockquote>

He certainly would have been held accountable for the lapse in judgment had he been on the POLITICO staff at the time,"" Harris told POLITICO. ""He&rsquo;s made clear that remark did not reflect his personal views or professional standards. This is a journalist who carries with him more than a decade of accomplishment and a well-earned reputation for fairness. We do not believe that lapse in one moment negates a reputation held in high regard by political professionals in both parties. He's superbly well-qualified to help us achieve a strategic goal that is very important for POLITICO.""

<p>Really? All it takes is an apology and the Old Media establishment forgives everything? We could probably count on one finger the number of Republicans who have gotten in trouble of their own making, apologized for it, and was later accepted back with open arms by the media. Or maybe no fingers would better reflect the list?

But instead of celebrating this man's great success, CNN slams him as ""<a href=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/10/rich-worried-and-buying-ad-time/"">Rich, Worried and Buying Ad Time</a>.""
</p>
<p>Thomas Peterffy was born under Soviet oppression in Budapest in 1944. At 21 years of age, Peterffy left his native country and came to America to try and make his way in life.
</p>
<p>""As a young boy, I was fantasizing about one day going to America, making a success of myself. The American Dream,"" Peterffy told CNN.
</p>
<p>He succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in this land of opportunity. In fact, Peterffy succeeded far beyond what he ever <em>could</em> have achieved in the communist country of his birth. Should he have stayed in that oppressed land, he could never have become the billionaire he became in the U.S.
</p>
<p>Now, he's truly is ""worried,"" as CNN noted. Peterffy is worried that the U.S. has so taken its freedoms and liberties for granted that the country is sliding toward becoming a socialist nation. And this is something he most certainly wants to warn his fellow citizens against.
</p>
<p>To warn America against the perils of socialism, Mr. Peterffy is buying TV ad time in key states to tell us all that this is the wrong economic path to tread.
</p>
<p>""America's wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success. Take away their incentive with badmouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy,"" he says in his TV commercial.
</p>
<p>Peterffy, now worth $4.6 billion according to Forbes, says he's paid $1.9 billion in taxes over his lifetime thus far and he'll be darned if he'll be told he isn't paying his fair share.
</p>
<p>Thomas Peterffy is exactly the sort of immigrant this country should be celebrating -- a man that came here with nothing and rose to become a leader and jobs maker.
</p>
<p>Yet, instead of celebrating this man as a successful immigrant, CNN just highlights his being ""rich."" As if that is something to scold him for. Why, for instance, didn't CNN headline its story something like ""Successful Immigrant Warns America""?
</p>
<p>As it happens, Peterffy is right to be worried. But it isn't just an out of control government that he should worry about. This sort of bias in the Old Media establishment is helping drive this country toward the evils of socialism. The media is as much an enemy as big government, nanny state thinking is. Peterffy has more to worry about than he thinks.

</p>
<p>On Friday morning's <em>Starting Point</em>, CNN's O'Brien and correspondent Dana Bash were all atwitter over Biden and Raddatz' work at the debate.
</p>
<p>Right out of the gate, O'Brien gushed about Raddatz, saying, ""I thought she was terrific.""</p>
<p>Bash agreed saying, ""Absolutely. If there was a winner because it was a draw between the two candidates, Martha Raddatz. She was commanding. She followed up when she need to. She pressed them on specifics.""
</p>
<p>Raddatz' performance was ""perfect pitch,"" Bash added.
</p>
<p>Bash went on to give excuses to deflate criticisms of Biden's churlish debate performance.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's so few undecideds at this point that that is a big reason, we're told, why Joe Biden did what he did, because the Democratic base was really deflated, demoralized, after the President didn't deliver from their perspective. That's why he was frankly in many ways over the top. In some ways that's who he is, but it's why he did what he did. If you talk about what happened in the spin room afterwards, that was the big debate -- was he disrespectful for Joe being Joe?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Biden's constant interruptions as Paul Ryan attempted to answer the questions put to him -- it was counted, he did so <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/12/UPDATE-Biden-Interrupted-Ryan-85-Times-During-Debate"">85 times</a> -- and Raddatz' badgering of Ryan along with her own campaign of interrupting the GOP vice presidential nominee -- <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/10/12/liberal-media-split-over-how-to-spin-raddatz-and-biden-performance-at-debate/"">her count was 31 interruptions</a> -- was a cause for celebration for O'Brien and Bash.
</p>
<p>Not only did O'Brien and Bash gush over how wonderful the tag team of Biden/Raddatz were, they even dismissed Smirking Joe's childish behavior as just &ldquo;Joe being Joe,&rdquo; as if that somehow excuses it all.
</p>
<p>But even as Bash and O'Brien tried to act as if Biden was trying to ""appeal to the middle,"" one thing seems sure. Biden's circus-like performance <a href=""http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/11/cnn-poll-on-debate-winner-ryan-48-biden-44/?hpt=hp_t1"">didn't help</a> team Obama with undecideds and moderates.
</p>
<p>The CNN pair also dismissed the several lies that Joe Biden told during that debate. For one, Biden lied when he said that no one in the U.S. embassy in Libya requested increased security measures. They most certainly did. <a href=""http://triblive.com/usworld/nation/2756889-74/security-attack-state-libya-benghazi-department-committee-hearing-republicans-washington#axzz299GIKp12"">But the Obama administration denied their requests for more security</a>. Biden also lied when he said he never voted for any of our recent wars. <a href=""http://freebeacon.com/biden-claims-he-voted-against-afghanistan-iraq-wars/"">He absolutely did</a>. But none of that mattered to the star stuck pair from CNN.
</p>
<p>Still, I suppose disgorging outright falsehoods could easily be considered just ""Joe being Joe."" <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/12/Fact-Check-Top-Ten-Worst-Lies-by-Joe-Biden-in-VP-Debate"">Those weren't the only two lies</a> he laid on the American public that night. In fact, he has a <a href=""http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/joe-bidens-pathetic-history-of-lies-and-plagiarism/question-3240477/"">long history of such dissembling</a>.
</p>
<p>Now, it is absolutely true that left-wingers loved Joe's un-presidential performance. It seems that Biden's entire purpose at that debate was not to appeal to level-headed voters interested in hearing serious answers. His job was to shore up the far left base that is starting to abandon Obama. This is why O'Brien and Bash loved Joe's cretinous behavior, of course.
</p>
<p>One would rightly understand that if Obama is still trying to solidify his base only weeks before the election, that is a bad sign for the President&rsquo;s reelection effort.

Beyond defending Biden's interruptions and awkward laughter, Taibbi considers this approach the model for ""objective"" journalists covering the Republican presidential ticket.</p>
<p>Posting on his ""Taibblog"" the morning after the debate, the rave review read:</p>

What he got absolutely right, despite what you might read this morning (many outlets are <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/vice-presidential-debate-bidens-smirk-causes-mixed-reactions/2012/10/12/a1e0b1d6-1475-11e2-bf18-a8a596df4bee_story.html"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: transparent;"" target=""_blank"">criticizing</a>&nbsp;Biden's dramatic excesses), was his tone. Biden did absolutely roll his eyes, snort, laugh derisively and throw his hands up in the air whenever Ryan trotted out his little beady-eyed BS-isms.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">But he&nbsp;should&nbsp;have! He was absolutely right to be doing it. We all should be doing it. That includes all of us in the media, and not just paid obnoxious-opinion-merchants like me, but so-called ""objective"" news reporters as well. We should all be rolling our eyes, and scoffing and saying, ""Come back when you're serious.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffffff;"">...</span></p>
<p>The proper way to report such a tactic is to bring to your coverage exactly the feeling that Biden brought to the debate last night: contempt and amazement. We in the press should be offended by what Romney and Ryan are doing &ndash; we should take professional offense that any politician would try to whisk such a gigantic lie past us to our audiences, and we should take patriotic offense that anyone is trying to seize the White House using such transparently childish and dishonest tactics.</p>

<p>In addition, Raddatz visited the White House on December 18, 2009.

<p>Twice, Biden accused Romney and Ryan of hating America. The first instance came during a discussion of Iran: ""I mean, these guys bet against America all the time,"" Biden said, claiming--falsely--that President Barack Obama had ""brought the entire world, including Russia and China"" to support harsh sanctions against Iran. (In fact, the Obama administration won Russian and Chinese support only by exempting them from key anti-Iran sanctions.)</p>
<p>The second time came during a defense of the administration's economic record: ""I have never met two guys who are more down on America across the board,"" Biden said, implying they are cheering for economic failure.</p>
<p>As Charles&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/mleewelch/status/256612859524562946"" target=""_blank"">noted</a>, Obama had once campaigned specifically on a promise never to attack his opponent's patriotism. In June 2008, Obama <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/barack-obama-i-question-patriotism-article-1.298002"" target=""_blank"">declared</a>: ""I will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign.""</p>
<p>Ryan repeatedly pointed out that Biden and Obama were running the kind of negative campaign that Obama, at least, had once rejected. The media--perhaps distracted by Biden's bizarre mannerisms--missed Biden's ugly attacks almost entirely. It goes without saying that if Ryan had questioned Biden's patriotism in anything like the same way, that would have become an object of obsessive fascination for the media in post-debate analysis.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/1LDkKscBEHQ"" width=""1"" />"

Now it&rsquo;s the New York Times that has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/us/politics/full-transcript-of-the-vice-presidential-debate.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"">cut</a> a key phrase (and one of the best lines of the night) from Paul Ryan&rsquo;s <em>closing</em> speech in his debate with Joe Biden last night.</p>
<p>For those who watched or listened to the debate, remember Ryan saying this as he closed? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency, or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fine so far, right? But then Ryan continued, &ldquo;<em>And we will not blame others for the next four years.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nowhere in the New York Times transcript. It&rsquo;s been cut out. The stark contrast Ryan pointed out between two men who will take responsibility and the two men at the head of this country who whine, blame, and point fingers at everyone but themselves has absolutely disappeared form the New York Times, which claims it published a &ldquo;full transcript of vice-presidential debate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neat and dirty trick. What Ryan followed with was this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will take responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding principles; we will reapply our founding principles. The choice is clear, and the choice rests with you, and we ask you for your vote. Thank you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The edit is very smooth; if you read the transcript and hadn&rsquo;t seen or heard the debate the transition looks perfect.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not everything Ryan said, and the power of that one elided phrase was palpable. The New York Times has needed to change their byline for years. How in the world can they <em>ever </em>claim &ldquo;<em>All</em> the news that&rsquo;s fit to print&rdquo;?</p>

This morning, the <i>Columbus Dispatch</i> out of the crucial swing state of Ohio, published a brutal (because it's true) editorial lashing out at Obama's dishonest and incompetent mishandling of Libya:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">The fact of a successful terrorist attack against the U.S. on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks &mdash; a day, above all others, when security for American officials in volatile countries should be at its utmost &mdash; is demoralizing and infuriating. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">After months of concern by diplomats in Libya about the country&rsquo;s deteriorating security, Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three embassy employees were murdered by heavily armed and organized terrorists. The possibility the government could have prevented their deaths by responding to their pleas for greater security is devastating. &hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">What is equally evident is that, despite repeated concerns by diplomats working in Libya, the administration shortchanged security. And when the worst happened, it wasn&rsquo;t willing to tell the truth to the American people. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">And as of Wednesday, administration officials continued to insist that the consulate had adequate security. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">The tragedy is magnified by the fact that Stevens, by all accounts, was passionately devoted to restoring Libya as a U.S. ally. He wanted to help build a democratic nation. But he wasn&rsquo;t blind to the danger still posed by militant Islamists and other anti-American groups. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">The murder of Stevens and his colleagues raises serious questions about the administration&rsquo;s priorities and competence.</p>

This is the moment most likely to haunt&nbsp; Obama for the rest of the election.

And it's easy to see why. Raddatz allowed Joe Biden to interrupt Paul Ryan repeatedly during the Vice Presidential debate, and interrupted Ryan herself, while posing questions that were radically in favor of the Obama team.&nbsp;Ryan overcame Raddatz's bias and won the debate regardless, leaving less for conservatives to complain about.</p>
<p>Still, it is worth noting the facts. While the candidates' speaking time was roughly equal--not counting crosstalk, Biden spoke for 38:25 and Ryan 37:27--Raddatz&rsquo;s questions were not in any way a measure of equality.&nbsp;She hit the Republican no fewer than nine times with pointed questions that were either an attack on Romney/Ryan or a way to set up excuses for Obama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one time Raddatz confronted Biden, it was to ask him to elaborate on what he meant by ""a bunch of stuff"" in attacking Ryan's honesty--setting Biden up to elaborate. That sole question is <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/martha-raddatz-debate-moderating_n_1959993.html"" target=""_blank"">cited</a> by Huffington Post as evidence of Raddatz's even-handedness.</p>
<p>Here are Raddatz's attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Attack #1</strong>: <strong>Holding Ryan and Romney, not Biden or Obama, accountable for Libya statements.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney -- and you&rsquo;re talking about this again tonight -- talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Raddatz was providing cover for Biden, as she primed the topic of Libya by focusing on the intelligence gathered and what ""people"" said, rather than the Obama Administration&rsquo;s lying about the cause of the attack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What were you first told about the attack? Why were people talking about protests? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters. Why did that go on for weeks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Attack #2</strong>: <strong>Asking Ryan--and only Ryan--to respond to American misdeeds in war.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about -- the Romney campaign talks a lot about no apologies. He has a book called &ldquo;No Apologies.&rdquo; Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning Qurans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Attack #3: Asking what the Romney/Ryan team would do, but not Obama/Biden, about Iran.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How will you do it so quickly? Look, you both saw Benjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb with the red line and talking about the red line being in spring. So can you solve this -- if the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, can you solve this in two months before spring and avoid nuclear &ndash;</p>
<p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<strong>Attack #4</strong>: <strong>Asking Ryan specific questions on unemployment, while letting Biden avoid them.</strong>
<p>Raddatz asked when each team expected to get unemployment below 6%, but then, after Biden was evasive, kept asking Ryan: &ldquo;When could you get it below 6 percent?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Attack #6: Attacking Ryan--and only Ryan--for past legislative stances,</strong></p>
<p>While discussing Medicare, Biden brought up Social Security for a moment. Ryan responded, and then Raddatz suddenly turned to Ryan and accused, &ldquo;You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with President Bush when he was seeking to partially privatize Social Security.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Attack #7: Accusing Ryan of not offering ""specifics""--and interrupting him:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>""You have refused yet again to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it, and that&rsquo;s why you won&rsquo;t tell voters?&rdquo; After Ryan tried to explain, she cut him off, barking, &ldquo;Do you have the specifics? Do you have the math? Do you know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; She followed by interrupting him again, &ldquo;No specifics, yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<strong>Attack #8: Falsely accusing Ryan of wanting to add to the defense budget.</strong>
<p>Ryan tried over and over to explain that he and Romney weren&rsquo;t increasing the defense budget, just not cutting it, but Raddatz was deaf to him. Thus:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raddatz: And you&rsquo;re going -- and you&rsquo;re going to increase the defense budget.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ryan: Think about it this way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Raddatz: And you&rsquo;re going to increase the defense budget.</p>
<p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<strong>Attack #9: Asking Ryan, not Biden, about the implications of his stance on abortion.</strong>
<p>Instead of asking Biden why his administration favors abortion-on-demand, Raddatz turned on Ryan:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to go back to the abortion question here. If the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried?</p>
<p>
</p>
</blockquote>
It&rsquo;s sickening to think that the Republicans have to fight their opponents as well as the moderators in these debates. Those who were suspicious of Raddatz before the debate were absolutely correct.&nbsp;
<p>It is a testament to Ryan's success that he managed to maintain his composure and win a two-to-one battle, according to most polls.</p>

The attacks resulted in the deaths of four Americans, one of them our own ambassador. </p>
<p>The <em>Times</em> has decided to ignore the recent hearings about what the Obama administration knew and when it knew it. There&rsquo;s just no &ldquo;news&rdquo; to it, the paper&rsquo;s editors say. ""It&rsquo;s three weeks before the election and it&rsquo;s a politicized thing, but if they had made significant news, we would have put it on the front [page],"" said <em>Times</em> managing editor, Dean Baquet.
</p>
<p>It isn't because the entirety of the administration claimed that the attacks in Libya grew spontaneously out of existing protests over some unseen anti-Islam Youtube video when the <em>truth</em> is that it was a planned attack. It isn't because the administration repeatedly claimed that the attacks were not terror attacks, even though they were. It isn't that now, all of a sudden, that same administration has done a 180 on all those false claims. No, it's a story now only because the Republicans won't let it just fade away like Obama wants it to. It&rsquo;s just politics.
</p>
<p>Move along, <em>The New York Times</em> says. Nothing to see here.
</p>
<p>This hypocritical stance adopted by Baquet is so bad that <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/new-york-times-nothing-significantly-new-in-libya-138170.html"">even Politico had to take notice the story</a>.
</p>
<p>Baquet, Politico notes, has said that he doesn't see ""anything significantly new"" in the ongoing congressional hearings on the situation in Libya. <em>Times</em>&nbsp;Executive Editor, Jill Abramson agrees, saying that the proceedings are just 'politicized"" and not worthy of notice from the ""paper of record.""
</p>
<p>Not everyone at the <em>Times</em> is giving the Obama administration cover on his complete collapse of foreign policy. <em>Times</em> Public Editor Margaret Sullivan recently wrote that the <em><a href=""http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/why-wasnt-libya-hearing-on-page-a1-of-the-times/?smid=tw-share"">Times</a></em><a href=""http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/why-wasnt-libya-hearing-on-page-a1-of-the-times/?smid=tw-share""> was making a mistake</a> to refuse to cover the hearings.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the Libya hearing story belonged on The Times&rsquo;s front page. It had significant news value, regardless of the political maneuvering that is inevitable with less than four weeks to go until the election. And more broadly, there is a great deal of substance on this subject that warrants further scrutiny.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blame-the-Republicans meme is the way that team Obama is trying to paper over the slew of lies unleashed by the Dept. of State and Hillary Clinton, the whole milieu of the administration, and even the President himself in his visit to the UN, no less.
</p>
<p>We've seen Obama spokesperson <a href=""http://hotair.com/archives/2012/10/11/stephanie-cutter-benghazi-is-only-an-issue-because-of-romney-and-ryan/"">Stephanie Cutter</a> unleash this nonsense, Robert Gibbs has disgorged it, so has <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/09/12/romney-calls-obama-response-to-libya-attacks-disgraceful/"">Ben LaBolt</a>, along with Obama's press secretary Jay Carney.
</p>
<p>But despite the spin, CNN has a devastating <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/world/libya-attack-statements/index.html"">timeline of what the Obama administration said</a> about the attacks on our Libyan embassy and it&nbsp;<em>clearly shows</em> that multiple sources in the Obama administration falsely blamed this Youtube video for the attacks.
</p>
<p>If the fact that the administration lied bald faced to the American people for days before finally admitting the truth isn't news, what exactly <em>is news</em> to <em>The New York Times</em>?

The plan, NJ claims, won't help middle-income Americans because they ""don't have investment income."" But, apparently <em>Nat'l Journal</em> didn't bother to look at Romney's actual plan because their assessment is simply wrong.
</p>
<p>Reporting on a Romney rally in Ohio, <em>Nat'l Journal</em> claimed that Romney's tax plan is one-sided.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Romney&rsquo;s proposal as he described it -- eliminating tax on interest, dividends, and capital gains -- would largely help those living on investment income, which does not include many people in the middle class. The tax break would likely help senior citizens, however, many of whom do live on investment income.
</p>
<p>...The wealthy are the major beneficiaries of low taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; many middle-income Americans don&rsquo;t have investment income.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently <em>Nat'l Journal</em> isn't big on doing its research. The <em>fact</em> is, Romney <em>isn't proposing</em> lowering capital gains taxes on ""the rich.""
</p>
<p>On his website, Romney <a href=""http://www.mittromney.com/issues/tax"">specifically says</a> that anyone making over $200,000 a year will see their taxes stay the same as they are now, but that anyone making <em>less than that</em> are the ones for whom he'd cut the cap gains tax.
</p>
<p>At least since February 21 of this year, Romney has been saying that any taxpayer making $200,000 and less will see their taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest income completely eliminated.
</p>
<p>Here are the bullet points on the Romney website:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make permanent, across-the-board 20 percent cut in marginal rates
    </li>
    <li>Maintain current tax rates on interest, dividends, and capital gains
    </li>
    <li>Eliminate taxes for taxpayers with AGI below $200,000 on interest, dividends, and capital gains
    </li>
    <li>Eliminate the Death Tax
    </li>
    <li>Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</li>
</ul>
<p>(AGI = adjusted gross income, and AMT = alternative minimum tax)
</p>
<p>The upshot here is that <em>National Journal</em> specifically said that Romney's cap gains tax cut would help only the rich, but Romney isn't proposing to cut their cap gains tax in the first place.

</p>
<p>Amusingly, during his CNBC <em>Squawkbox</em> appearance back on October 3, Todd seemed to imagine that ""spending money"" equates to good polling. Several times he adamantly repeated that he and his cohorts at NBC spent a lot of money or spend more money than Rasmussen does on polling. Can you just <em>buy good polling</em>, Mr. Todd?
</p>
<p>This week Mr. Rasmussen had a chance to respond to Todd's taunt on Fox News with host Megyn Kelly.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>""Now all these polls are showing what you are showing,"" Kelly said to Rasmussen. Despite that, Kelly said, Chuck Todd attacked Rasmussen's results.
</p>
<p>Rasmussen agreed that the current polls are suddenly all showing what he's been saying all along, that the race is close and could easily go either way in November.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""We've been showing this race to be close for a long time. As other polls shift to a likely voters model they're showing the same thing. Four years ago we showed virtually no change in the final 40 days of the campaign, we've shown a steady raise this time. Both men have been within three points of each other for 89 of the last 100 days and we're happy to compare our work to anybody's.""
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kelly went on to remind viewers that Rasmussen was hailed as the best pollster of the 2008 election while NBC news ranked in at a lowly 13th place.
</p>
<p>Kelly ended slamming Todd. ""But what he said was mean, Scott"" she said.
</p>
<p>""I get used to it after a while. It's part of the life of being a pollster,"" Rasmussen bemusedly replied.

<p><strong>MSNBC Not Melting Down, But Also Not Celebrating</strong></p>
<p>Fascinating dynamic on MSNBC. It's always an echo chamber but it's not as though they're energized and popping champagne corks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CNN Hits Biden On His Condescending Smirks</strong></p>
<p>For the most part CNN is calling the debate a draw on substance. But on style, the CNN panel is hitting him hard for being kins of a jerk. </p>
<p>Ryan passed the test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Horrible Moderator: Martha Raddatz Interrupts Ryan Constantly, Asks Stupid Questions</strong></p>
<p>Why would Raddatz about ask about manhood in this economy? And her constant interrupting of Ryan every time he was about to make a point came off as intentional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pretty Mind-Blowing CNN Employs Race-Baiting, Extremist Commie Truther Van Jones</strong></p>

<p><strong>CNN Reports Ryan's Zinger If Biden Plays The Hometown Scranton Guy</strong></p>
<p>CNN just reported that if Biden tries to play the hometown, every day, lunch bucket Scranton boy, Ryan's going to remind him that when Obama took office in 2008, the unemployment rate in Scranton was 8%. Now it's over&nbsp;10%.</p>
<p>Good strategy by the Romney campaign leaking this this late. Goes right to the heart of Biden's gameplan and you can bet they're scrambling right now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Washington Post's</em> JournOlist Inventor Calls Ryan a Liar</strong></p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind about Ezra Klein is that the corrupt <em>Washington Post</em> presents this unbelievably dishonest leftist as an objective journalist. He's on MSNBC as much as anyone at Politico and even guest-hosts Rachel Maddow's show -- but he's objective. </p>
<p>Anyway, he's on with Maddow now geeking out over some time he spent wonking with Paul Ryan and in that matter-of-fact way the corrupt media's perfected, he tells Rachel that while you never catch Ryan off guard in a debate; he always has an answer, but sometimes he'll just make numbers up instead of admit he's wrong. </p>
<p>I expect this from MSNBC, but what's notable is that this is&nbsp;WaPo's ""objective"" journalist laying The Narrative Track about Ryan being a liar and that we can expect him to lie during this debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Todd Is Full of It</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry, but the Dr. No of media bias is just full of it. </p>
<p>He was just on MSNBC with Rachel Madow spinning the poll numbers. ""They're back to pre-debate levels,"" he says reassuringly. ""But the president still has an edge."" </p>
<p>The problem with Todd, other than the fact that he's a dishonest race-baiter, is that he's in a bubble marked ""media polls."" He refuses to acknowledge any poll other than the media ones that tell him what he so desperately wants to hear. </p>
<p>This shill called Rasmussen polls ""slop.""</p>
<p>In 2008, Rasmussen was the most reliable pollster in America -- #1. </p>
<p>Todd's precious NBC polls ranked somewhere arround #15. </p>
<p>He's just the worst. </p>

<p><strong>CNN's Dana Bash Hammers Ryan On Janesville Plant Closing, Edits His Answer Out</strong></p>
<p>For the record, I like Dana Bash. She's one of the better political reporters out there. But as we all know, the Obama campaign's theme since last week's debate debacle is LIAR! So Bash dredges up this tired old canard of the Ryan convention-speech video where he talks about the Obama coming to Wisconsin in '08, promises to keep an auto plant open, and doesn't keep the promise. </p>
<p>Bash then informs Ryan that Democrats and ""fact-checkers"" called him a liar. Ryan is more then ready for this but his response is truncated by an awkward edit. </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>If you're going to work that hard to set up the question, let the man answer in full. &nbsp;</p>

<p>These photos, which show Ryan doing curls on a workout bench with his hat on backwards and listening to music on his earphones, are meant to make Ryan seem goofy and make him look anything but serious before his debate against Vice President Joe Biden. Democrats have tried to paint Ryan as a ""frat boy"" in order to delegitimize his serious and substantive budget plan, and this is an example of the mainstream media again aiding Democrats in driving narratives against Republicans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These photos were never intended to make the final cut and get published, which is why Ryan was free to goof off in them. And yet&nbsp;<em>Time, </em>which&nbsp;had these photos since November of 2011, decided to not-so-coincidentally publish them anyway hours before Ryan's debate with Biden. Four of the five outtakes published were of Ryan in workout gear while a fifth was of Ryan in a suit sitting on a workout bench.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week, the Associated Press <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/09/Media-Bias-Summed-Up-in-Two-Photos"">published&nbsp;</a>a photo its editors knew would lead viewers to think a school-age girl was staring at Romney's butt. Of course, this was meant to get laughs at Romney's expense and hurt him among casual voters. During the 2008 election, <em>Newsweek</em> ran a cover photo of Sarah Palin that zoomed in uncomfortably close on her face while other mainstream media outlets ran close-up photos of her bare legs.&nbsp;</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/x_3kmayPGUk"" width=""1"" />"

Karpel, a former leftist community organizer who has become a political conservative, asks the salient question: </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;""><em>Why are so many voters in non-battleground states intent on voting to re-elect Barack Obama despite his dismal performance?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Karpel answers his own question this way; these voters are suffering from an Obama addiction. Thus he asserts that only a 12-Step program will heal them, and urges these voters to host and attend Alcoholics Anonymous-type meetings to ""work&nbsp;the steps"" by confessing their addiction and committing to go&nbsp;through ""Democratic detox"" and ""Republican rehab.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book begins:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""My name is Craig K., and I'm an Obamaholic. Welcome to what Alcoholics Anonymous would call a 'meeting in print.' We're here to admit to each other and to ourselves that the Obama presidency isn't Obama's fault -- it's ours. We should be impeached for having elected him.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The series of confessions includes: </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""Obama's election was the triumph&nbsp;of biography over achievement. We allowed ourselves to become Obama-news junkies,&nbsp;in the grip of lack-of-substance abuse.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""Outside of technical fields --&nbsp;proverbially, brain surgery and rocket science -- academic credentials are an indication&nbsp;not of achievement, but of promise. Thus it is that government agencies are staffed&nbsp;mostly with failures who were once considered promising, while the business world is&nbsp;full of unpredicted successes.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""There's a dangerous downside to the fact that the United States is not a constitutional monarchy: Because we have no powerless nobility to invest with charisma, we look for it in candidates for the country's highest office, running the risk of attributing magical qualities to an unworthy president, who, unlike Britain's ineffectual royals, can cause real trouble.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""Liberalism isn't a political philosophy -- it's a thought disorder.&nbsp;Because liberals are unable to think through the relationship between causes and effects,&nbsp;they're rarely able to anticipate the consequences of any action. For this reason, the main&nbsp;consequences of most liberal policies are the unintended consequences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""Occupy Wall Street was, essentially,&nbsp;demonstrating in favor of blame. Democrats crowed that it was their version of the Tea&nbsp;Party, and they were correct. The Tea Party is primarily about having a federal&nbsp;government that's fiscally sustainable. Occupy's '99 percenters' were the Me Party: 'I&nbsp;want mine, paid for by you.'""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""Denial is our inner mind saying to&nbsp;our outer mind, 'Nothing to see here. Move along.'. . . Even when we realized that this&nbsp;president was incompetent, we were in denial about our own incompetence as voters.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.5in;"">""Unless we&nbsp;start, as Alcoholics Anonymous puts it, 'working the steps,' we're certain to have Obama&nbsp;again -- and after him, more Obamas. To attain voting sobriety by November 6, 2012,&nbsp;we recovering Obama voters need to support a candidate who, as president, can begin the&nbsp;hard work of restoring government to its constitutional place in American life.""&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great book to hand to the Obama voter who is beginning to have second thoughts. And there is a growing number of those voters. They&rsquo;re in pain; they could use a gift. </p>

The media finally figured out that the reason President Obama got manhandled by Mitt Romney last Tuesday night was due to the fact that the referee never tackled his opponent for him. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That night's moderator, Jim Lehrer, did at times try to rescue Obama, but nowhere near enough to even bring the debate to a draw so the corrupt media could declare Obama the winner. Ever since, the pressure's been mounting for future moderators to insert themselves more into the upcoming debates -- and we all know what <a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=6B3D4E71-D372-419F-8141-12B0494A7A31"">that means</a>:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">When &ldquo;opaque numbers&hellip; random statistics&hellip; or declarative claims&hellip; take center stage&hellip; the moderator MUST step in, put himself or herself between the candidates and the public, and press the participant on the veracity of the claim or puncture the spin with facts,&rdquo; he argued.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And we all know what THAT means -- it means that a debate moderator with a liberal worldview on political, fiscal, and social issues, will hit the Republican with fact-checks based on a false premise. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Past is prologue, and I'm much less concerned by the fact that Barack Obama was a guest at the wedding of tonight's moderator, than I am with <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/10/Flashback-Moderator-Martha-Raddatz-Stunned-John-Silber-s-Campaign-for-MA-Governor-in-1990-Debate"">her performance as a questioner in a 1990 debate</a> that dramatically shifted the momentum of a gubernatorial race in Massachusetts. Rather than stay out of the way, she hammered away at a candidate the media did not approve of and apparently did some real damage.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">That's not a debate moderator's job. That's the job of the opponent and if the opponent chooses not to raise certain issues, that doesn't mean the referee is supposed to jump in and make the tackle for him. This is a debate between two individuals, not a press conference or television interview. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">You see, when our media overlords crybaby over Jim Lehrer's ""passivity,"" what they really mean is, ""Why didn't Lehrer ask Romney about the 47-percent."" </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obama lost Tuesday night because Lehrer created an environment that allowed for a free-flow exchange of ideas from The Men Who Would Be President. And it was in this perfect and ideal debate environment that we discovered who had the best ideas, who was better prepared to defend those ideas, and something about the mettle of both. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obama lost because his ideas are indefensible, his record is indefensible, and with very rare exception, the media palace guards for him -- so he's simply not used to being challenged. (A <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/11/Diane-Sawyer-Joins-Obama-Campaign"">perfect example</a>.) </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obama lost that debate because Jim Lehrer refused to palace guard for him, and now, after a half-century of being held in the highest esteem among his colleagues, Lehrer is now being humiliated and mocked as a message to the other three moderators: ""Palace guard, or else&hellip;""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">So Ryan had better be prepared tonight because Raddatz has been given the clear choice of either holding her place in the warm esteem of her colleagues or getting a taste of the scorn heaped on 78 year-old Jim Lehrer. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This of course is just as true for CNN's Candy Crowley and CBS News' Bob Schieffer, the moderators of the final two presidential debates. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The media's absolutely ruthless in getting what it wants. Raddatz knows this. Crowley knows this. Schieffer knows this. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Let's just hope Romney and Ryan are prepared for it. </p>

Tens of thousands of patriotic Americans are searching voter rolls for dead and invalid voter registrations. These same patriots will monitor thousands of polling sites, recording any deviation from legal procedures and standing as silent sentinels against lawlessness in the election.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.truethevote.org/"">True the Vote</a> and affiliated groups across the nation are leading this charge.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">For this public service, vile dishonest elements of the Left and their duped surrogates in Congress have attacked them. A parade of shameless attackers have pushed a dishonest narrative about these groups. Among them are the <a href=""http://www.demos.org/tova-andrea-wang"">Demos</a> (a group <a href=""http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/funderprofile.asp?fndid=5181"">funded</a> by the <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/03/27/soros-loses-insider-trading-conviction-appeal"">convicted felon</a> George Soros), <a href=""http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&amp;b=4860257"">Common Cause</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.brennancenter.org/pages/about/"">Brennan Center</a> at NYU Law. These purportedly non-partisan organizations have played an aggressive role in attacking Tea Party efforts to ensure that the 2012 elections are free from voter fraud.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">They are all vote fraud deniers.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The most dishonest and racialist of the attackers, however, is <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/authors/brentin-mock"">Brentin Mock at <em>The&nbsp;Nation</em></a>.&nbsp; Apparently, this magazine has no editorial standards for honesty and accuracy, else they would terminate their relationship with Mock.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><img alt="""" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Wrong Dimensions and Stretched Images/brentin_mock_CL.jpg"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 5px; width: 170px; height: 225px;"" /></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">He felt compelled to crash the True the Vote Summit in Houston last spring to spy on the Tea Party group&rsquo;s volunteer training. Mock <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/167648/true-vote-still-out-screw-vote"">mocked</a> former Democrat Congressman Artur Davis after Davis <a href=""http://vimeo.com/41885622"">spoke</a> of protesters outside the training.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">&ldquo;Topping it off, former Congressman Artur Davis (yes, that one) had some kind words for the protesters outside the conference. But if there were actual protesters, they must have been invisible.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">I <a href=""http://electionlawcenter.com/2012/05/01/how-does-the-nation-cover-true-the-vote-poorly.aspx"">snapped a photo</a> of the &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; protesters Mock wrote about, and <em>The Nation</em> has never corrected his inaccuracy.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><img alt="""" height=""205"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Wrong Dimensions and Stretched Images/Protesters.JPG"" width=""418"" /></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But Mock&rsquo;s inaccuracies aren&rsquo;t just clumsy and small; they are also large and defamatory. They are racialist and malicious. Worse, some politicians have been duped by him.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Let&rsquo;s stroll through Mock&rsquo;s greatest hits.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock Myth #1 &ndash; &ldquo;there are plenty of reports that show True the Vote has targeted neighborhoods that are majority people of color.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">There are also plenty of reports of Bigfoot and wood elves. All of these &ldquo;reports&rdquo; come from Mock&rsquo;s fellow travelers who share Mock&rsquo;s radical agenda. In truth, True the Vote monitors polls in every neighborhood. They have &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; (read: sued) two Republican-run election offices, including the Ohio Secretary of State. Mock cites not a lick of evidence for this assertion other than rumor and paranoia.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Logan Churchill of True the Vote sets the record straight: &ldquo;True The Vote has no legal ability to place or register poll watchers. Once a trainee has completed TTV coursework, it is the duty of the individual to seek placement as a poll watcher on behalf of a party, candidate or ballot measure proponent.&rdquo; True the Vote merely teaches people how to effectively monitor the polls, something nearly every state considers an important civic function, and they have enshrined the right into law.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock Myth # 2 &ndash; Tea Party poll watchers badger and intimidate voters.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock is highly agitated by white election integrity advocates appearing in predominately black precincts because of their skin color. He claims that they have &ldquo;intimidated&rdquo; black voters by &ldquo;getting in their face and hovering over them.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">His proof? Nothing; he can&rsquo;t produce a single voter to say they were treated this way.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In fact, Mock explicitly opposes white poll watchers being present in black precincts. &ldquo;There is obviously something really fishy that a bunch of white people from the Tea Party start showing up in the hood. And obviously that is going to be an unsettling thing. If you are in the hood anywhere in America that is going to be an unsettling thing. White people show up with clipboards.&rdquo; (<a href=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/10/rep_elijah_cummings_launches_true_the_vote_investigation.html"">Watch his dishonest version of events</a> <a href=""http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/10/rep_elijah_cummings_launches_true_the_vote_investigation.html"">at this video</a> beginning at minute 3:00-4:30)</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">No word on whether Mock opposes diversity in other public places.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here are the actual True the Vote training documents.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><img alt="""" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Wrong Dimensions and Stretched Images/TTV Training documents.JPG"" style=""width: 560px; height: 314px;"" /></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">If they have a program to train poll watchers to intimidate voters, the materials are awfully ineffective. &ldquo;True the Vote trains poll watchers that they cannot even give voters the time of day or directions to the restroom. While inside the polling place, observers are instructed only to speak with the election judges/poll workers,&rdquo; Churchill tells me.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock Myth #3 &ndash; True the Vote challenges minority voters at the polls.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock and his allies have stoked fears of poll &ldquo;vigilantes&rdquo; who will challenge minority voters on election day. This is an outright lie. Churchill explains, &ldquo;TTV trainees are alerted to all rights and abilities given to poll watchers according to local law, but are discouraged from offering direct challenges at the polling location. TTV places emphasis on poll watchers directing attention to poll workers, making certain that local procedural requirements are respected for the benefit of all voters.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">A nationwide army quietly standing watch at the polls will do more to deter criminal behavior on election day than voter challenges.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock Myth # 4 &ndash; Election integrity advocates are breaking federal laws.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock leads an October 8 <em>Nation</em> story with the headline: &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/170415/are-true-votes-poll-watching-activities-illegal"">Are True the Vote&rsquo;s Poll Watching Activities Illegal?&rdquo;</a>&nbsp; This is a deliberate effort to chill and deter political association and involvement. It is designed to threaten law abiding citizens with the fear of arrest if they participate legally in the political process and exercise rights under federal and state law.&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Who&rsquo;s suppressing whom?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">When you look at the laws upon which Mock and his crowd rely, you discover a shaky legal foundation.&nbsp;<a href=""http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/profiles/epps.cfm"">Garret Epps</a> at <em>The Atlantic</em> joins in the witch hunt &ndash; &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-klan-act-how-an-obscure-law-could-cut-down-on-bullying-at-the-polls/263374/"">The Klan Act: How an Obscure Law Could Cut Down on Bullying at the Polls</a>.&rdquo; Epps blusters that 42 U.S.C. 1985 could be used to criminally prosecute Tea Party poll observers.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The only problem is that the law requires the specific intent to &ldquo;intimidate, threaten or coerce&rdquo; people from voting.&nbsp; Good luck charging granny poll watcher with this law. Grandma doesn&rsquo;t bully anyone with her clipboard, pen, and purse. &ldquo;Intimidation and threats&rdquo; have rational definitions, not Mock&rsquo;s crazy paranoid standard that &ldquo;if white people are in the hood, blacks get uncomfortable.&rdquo; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">It makes you wonder what Mock doesn&rsquo;t want America to see in certain polls.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Incidentally, <a href=""https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Garrett+Epps+new+black+panthers&amp;oq=Garrett+Epps+new+black+panthers&amp;gs_l=hp.3..33i21.785.5652.0.5747.33.30.1.0.0.0.229.3824.5j22j1.28.0.les%3Bcfrsh..0.0...1.1.o1MBslb7wzw&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=7024e812c212ae0f&amp;bpcl=35243188&amp;biw=1441&amp;bih=656"">here</a> is Epps&rsquo; article about the use of the same statute against the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neGbKHyGuHU"">New Black Panther Party</a> in Philadelphia. (Psych! He never wrote about that incident. Like so many Leftist academics, he has selective outrage about election law.)</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Rather than breaking federal law, these Tea Party groups are enforcing federal laws that have laid dormant for decades. Section 8 of Motor Voter allows private parties to bring lawsuits to demand that the voter rolls are free of ineligible and dead voters. The Left didn&rsquo;t like the 1993 compromise with House Republicans that added Section 8 to the more familiar registration provisions. So they attack anyone who dares try to enforce federal law, particularly since Eric Holder <a href=""http://pjmedia.com/jchristianadams/2012/02/14/millions-of-dead-voters-brought-to-you-by-eric-holder/"">won&rsquo;t</a>. State laws provide a legal process for citizen challenges to potential deadwood on the rolls.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock Myth #5 &ndash; Pre-election challenges are targeting minorities.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Tea Party groups are searching the voter rolls for possibly improper voter registrations and alerting state authorities under state legal procedures. The examination of state voter rolls for problems are just that, statewide. Nobody is &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; except potentially invalid registrations, regardless of party affiliation or race. Simple standards are applied in this examination: is the voter dead; are they registered at a phony or inadequate address; are dozens or hundreds of voters registered at the same address?&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Pretty simple stuff. But to racialists, racial animus explains so much about America.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Mock has even managed to push two politicians out on a limb with his dishonest attacks. Both <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/07/True-the-vote-Cummings"">Senator Barbara Boxer</a> (D-CA) and <a href=""http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2012/10/05/rep-elijah-cummings-attacks-tea-party/"">Representative Elijah Cummings</a> (D-MD) have fallen for it and sent accusatory letters to True the Vote. True the Vote has challenged the pair to attend their training seminars to learn the truth. They have even offered to meet with them and explain the True the Vote program. That neither Boxer nor Cummings have accepted tells you all you need to know about the motivation of the pair of politicians. As with Mock, myth is more compelling than truth.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But perhaps Republican&rsquo;s shouldn&rsquo;t get too upset about Mock and his confederates terrifying democrats about armies of elderly ladies armed with clipboards. If Democrat voters really are so gullible to believe Mock&rsquo;s myths, then perhaps the GOP should just sit back, relax, and let them scare the hell out of their own voters for no reason.</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/80mNS3nqhKA"" width=""1"" />"

<p>Lach <a href=""http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/kareem_ahmed_priorities_usa_action_landmark.php?p=0"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> the conversation in his profile of Ahmed, ""The Obama Mega Donor Who Got Lost in the Crowd."" Ahmed, who has given more than $1.1 million to Obama, Democrats, and associated super PACs, boasts that House Minority Leader is a personal friend and hobnobs with other elite left-wing donors, but has been largely neglected by the media thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he learned that Lach would be writing an article about him, he began threatening defamation lawsuits and accusing Lach of working in cahoots with Republicans.</p>
<p>Ahmed is the founder of Landmark Medical Management, which provides account management services for the medical industry, especially in the field of workmen's compensation. As an ambitious businessman (he is not a doctor), he is enthusiastic about the medical and economic potential of new compound drug products. Like many left-wingers, Ahmed dislikes the idea of economic competition; unlike most, he is open about it:</p>
<blockquote class=""webkit-indent-blockquote"" style=""border: none; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 40px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;"">
<p>&ldquo;My problem is, I don&rsquo;t want competition,&rdquo; Ahmed said. &ldquo;I like to have a private life. I don&rsquo;t want people to copy my business model, which I have wasted millions on, with legal opinion letters, from whatever, perfecting it over years. I don&rsquo;t want people to take it for free, and start giving me competition. I&rsquo;m a businessman, too. That is why I&rsquo;m hesitant on answering all these things, because you&rsquo;re going to expose my entire business model, and everyone&rsquo;s going to say, &lsquo;Oh, thank you, Mr. Lach, now let&rsquo;s go compete, and give Mr. Ahmed and Landmark competition.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Landmark's use of compound drugs for injured workers is controversial--another reason for Ahmed's anxieties.&nbsp;</p>

All three hit the story, but all three are killing themselves to downplay an explosive scandal they know could damage Obama's reelection chances. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Yep, we're seeing all kinds of <b>dutiful </b>coverage, but as hard as some individual reporters are working, those who control The Narrative will never allow Libya to become one -- not with Their Precious One serving them up the distraction-material they crave, like Big Bird and abortion. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Having landed the first post-debate television interview with President Obama, it made sense for ABC's World News Tonight to lead with the interview -- except it wasn't an interview. For nearly six-minutes (what amounts to a full-quarter of the entire newscast) it got mighty uncomfortable watching ABC News' anchor Diane Sawyer give the president of the United States a full-body tongue bath. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">You can watch the video <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/wn"">here</a> (do so on an empty stomach). But the most effective way to see just how hard Sawyer worked to rehabilitate Obama and to give him a full six minutes of free network television time to spew anti-Romney, pro-woman talking points without a SINGLE challenge or follow-up question -- is to read her end of the ""interview."" </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Here are Sawyers idea of interview questions. I've summarized Obama's responses:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Let's get right to it. That debate; what happened?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama answers that he had a bad night. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> How bad?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama attacks Romney's honesty, repeats <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443982904578044942772937744.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"">his lie</a> about Romney's $5 trillion tax-cut skewed towards the wealthy and says Romney will rollback regulations. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Your supporters have been saying this wasn't a bad night, he didn't show up. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama says he'll do better. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Again, why did it happen? Al Gore said it was the altitude? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama laughs. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> No lesson learned from it? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama says Romney made a good sales pitch but the product isn't going to work. Romney has no new ideas.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> What did Mrs. Obama say to you when you got home that night?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama gushes over Michelle.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Is it possible you handed him the election that night?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama says, no. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> You're going to win? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama says, yes.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer</b>: You want it more than the first time?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama talks about taking Michelle to dinner and a waiter thanking him for saving his mom's life with ObamaCare. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> What's your message to Joe Biden?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama trashes Ryan's ""ideas.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Message to Romney about Tuesday night?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama says he has none. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Diane Sawyer then runs a clip that attacks Romney for a supposed flip-flop on abortion. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Your campaign has called [what Romney said about abortion] a ""lie.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama accuses Romney of hiding his positions. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><b>Sawyer:</b> Did he lie?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Obama launches into minute-long rant against Romney, challenges Romney's honesty and consistency. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Not a single question about the Libya cover up and not a single challenge to anything Obama said, including Obama's attacks on Romney and the fact that Obama is offering absolutely no vision for a second term.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This wasn't an interview; it was an infomercial meant to reassure the media that Obama understands he blew the first debate and will do better next time. And then, across public airwaves you and I own, Sawyer leaves the floor completely open for Obama to go unchallenged in his attack on Romney and to shift the ground of the campaign into the comfortable arena of abortion. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obviously,&nbsp; Sawyer's seen the same internals Team Obama has, and she knows exactly what he needs to wedge the closing gender gap. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The segment that followed was a Jake Tapper report on Libya, and to be perfectly fair to Sawyer, it was here that we learned she actually did ask Obama about Libya. But once again Obama's not challenged, he's simply allowed to get away with saying he told us what he knew when he knew it. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Which is a bald-faced lie. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But because Obama's the Sun God, he's allowed to look into The Face of ABC News and lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">What is especially ironic about Sawyer's rehab job yesterday, is that it's interviews like this that helped to create the Obama debate debacle. Obama's media pals are so desperate to protect Obama and to have him like them, that they never ever challenge their Sun God. Which is why he was a deer in the headlights when faced with a Mitt Romney who challenged, pushed, and pressured like the media's supposed to. </p>

</p>
<p>While doing research for his book, for instance, Moore discovered that a mere 10 percent of Americans pay nearly half the federal taxes in this country.
</p>
<p>With this fact at hand, Moore elaborated further in a recent <a href=""http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/moore-obama-tax-plan/2012/10/09/id/459261"">interview</a> saying that there is ""no case on economic grounds"" to vote for President Barack Obama, a candidate whose main ""solution"" to our economic woes is to raise taxes only on the wealthy.
</p>
<p>Moore labels Obama the ""anti-Clinton President"" because Obama drifts far from fiscal good sense of the last successful Democrat President, Bill Clinton.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody thinks that raising tax rates will improve the economy. At least I certainly hope no one does because the history is so unequivocal that that&rsquo;s not the case,&rdquo; Moore says.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moore says that Obama's prescription for what ails us is no cure.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What I show in this research is that the fairest system of them all is the free enterprise system. The free enterprise system is what creates growth, creates jobs and higher living standards for almost all Americans. So it&rsquo;s hard to improve on that system. President Obama believes that the way to create a fairer system is to redistribute income from the rich to the poor. That&rsquo;s never worked very well.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his book, Moore finds that we already disproportionately rely on ""the rich"" for our tax base and the top 10 percent here should more of the tax burden than their counterparts in Europe.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The United States is actually more dependent on rich people to pay taxes than even many of the more socialized economies of Europe. According to the Tax Foundation, the United States gets 45 percent of its total taxes from the top 10 percent of tax filers, whereas the international average in industrialized nations is 32 percent. America&rsquo;s rich carry a larger share of the tax burden than do the rich in Belgium (25 percent), Germany (31 percent), France (28 percent), and even Sweden (27 percent).""
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her <a href=""http://p.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/oct/9/picket-new-book-shows-us-top-earners-pay-larger-sh/"">discussion</a> of Moore's new book, Kerry Picket of the Washington Times makes an excellent point. Heaping confiscatory taxes on the rich is just a bad idea.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""...more tax revenue went back to the federal government each time the taxes were lowered. So does it really make sense to strip the upper income earners of their keep? Liberals have yet to answer how that ever improves the lives of the middle class or lower income earners in the long run.""
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of the middle and lower classes, Moore's analysis finds that, far from worsening, America has experienced a constant upward trend in the standard of living for both the middle and the lower class, a trend that has continued for the last 25 years.
</p>
<p>Moore also notes that there is a big difference between Obama's tax policy and that of GOP candidate Mitt Romney.
</p>
<p>""Interestingly, under Mitt Romney, the top tax rate would be about 28 percent. Under Barack Obama, the top tax rate goes up to 42 percent. That&rsquo;s a big difference,"" he said.
</p>
<p>Mr. Moore is a senior economics analyst as well as an editorial board member of The Wall Street Journal, the founder and president of the Club for Growth, and has written several books on economics and American life.

<p>So who are some of the people on Hill&rsquo;s list?</p>
<p>Christopher Columbus, described as &ldquo;an immoral treasure hunter&rdquo; and a &ldquo;vicious conquistador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elvis Presley: a &ldquo;cheap facsimile of Little Richard.&rdquo; Spoken like a true racist. </p>
<p>Ronald Reagan: &ldquo;largely responsible for shutting down mental hospitals, bloating the military, shrinking benefits for the needy, sparking mass incarceration, and declaring ketchup a vegetable for our children's school lunches.&rdquo; Also closing down the Soviet Union and rescuing the American economy, you moron.</p>
<p>Tim Tebow: noting that Tebow had some lousy quarters, Hill stated, &ldquo;Black men throw interceptions; White men are ""gunslingers.&rdquo; No one said Tebow was a great quarterback. What made Tebow great was the ability to win games but never lose his moral stature.</p>
<p>Babe Ruth &ndash; &ldquo;While there is no doubt that Babe Ruth was the most dominant player of his era, he was also the beneficiary of smaller playing fields and a segregated league. It may be clich&eacute; to say, but there's little doubt that Ruth would have lower career numbers if he had been forced to face Satchel Paige and his peers on a regular basis. Nevertheless, The Babe, rather than Hank Aaron or Willie Mays, continues to be the most celebrated figure in the history of the sport.&rdquo; Hey, ignoramus, ever look at Ruth&rsquo;s pitching record? He was also the dominant <em>pitcher</em> of his era.</p>
<p>And unbelievably and most egregiously, Shakespeare. &ldquo;Unfortunately, thanks to sycophantic critics and narrow-minded educational systems, Shakespeare is the only person who seems to matter to the average person &hellip; we ignore the fact that many aspects of Shakespeare's work -- such as the writing in Hamlet or the generally narrow range of female roles in his plays -- just aren't that awesome.&rdquo; This guy is saying <em>Hamlet </em>isn&rsquo;t great? Does Hill even understand the English language and its intricacies? You have got to be kidding me. Refusing to call <em>Hamlet </em>great just makes you look like an idiot.</p>
<p>There are others on the list who deserve it (Bill Clinton and Justin Bieber come to mind), but this column is just one more instance of a black racist venting his fury on the people who have largely civilized the modern world. Are there whites who are overrated? Sure.&nbsp; But if Hill really wanted to be truthful, he could have added one to the list: Barack Obama&rsquo;s mother. </p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/KaWxDO9hpa8"" width=""1"" />"

Paul Ryan, pundits are wondering whether the moderator,&nbsp;ABC News' Martha Raddatz, will comply with pressure from media colleagues to be more aggressive than Jim Lehrer of PBS was in last week's presidential debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is reason to believe she might: Raddatz has irked at least one campaign from the moderator's seat: the 1990 gubernatorial campaign of Democrat John Silber, president of Boston University.</p>
<p>Raddatz (at right, above) famously asked Silber why he had not campaigned more frequently in poor minority communities, prompting him to respond: ""There is no point in my making a speech on crime control to a group of drug addicts.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silber, amidst accusations of racism, fought to clarify his remarks in the days that followed, and <a href=""http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/tocn-mla000732-john-silber-holds-a-press-conference-in-roxbury"" target=""_blank"">visited</a> the predominantly black community of Roxbury in Boston--though he refused to apologize. He went on to win the Democratic primary by 10 points, though he lost to Republican William Weld in the general election.</p>
<p>While Silber was responsible for his own gaffe, public consensus was that Raddatz had likely aimed to knock him off balance, joining the media's general skepticism of--and opposition to--his campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<center></center>
<p>In the days that followed, Raddatz--then known as Martha Bradlee, after her first marriage to fellow reporter Ben Bradlee, Jr.--came under intense criticism from the League of Women Voters for what they called ""irrelevant,"" personal questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""During the debate, candidates Francis X. Bellotti and John R.&nbsp;Silber&nbsp;were asked, among other things, what they do when they see a homeless person, asked to describe their personal driving records, to comment on their prior knowledge of Kitty Dukakis' problems with drugs and alcohol and to itemize the value of their real estate holdings,"" reported Renee Loth of the <em>Boston Globe</em>&nbsp;at the time [1].&nbsp;</p>
<p>The League of Women Voters complained that Raddatz's questions produced ""no insight into the programs or policies of the candidates.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Democratic consultant agreed: ""I don't mind saying on the record that this was a crop of absolutely ridiculous, frivolous questions that were designed to call attention to the questioner,"" i.e. to Raddatz.</p>
<p>Silber's eventual triumph in the primary came despite strong opposition from the mainstream media, which had &nbsp;predicted he would lose. The media had been so active in their disdain for the politically-incorrect Silber that they became, in effect, part of the campaign, sparking a backlash from the public and from Silber himself.</p>
<p>In examining the media's role, the <em>Boston Globe</em> recounted a Silber quip from the campaign trail:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>""What the media have not adequately assessed,"" he said, ""is that if power tends to corrupt politicians and businessmen and lawyers, there's a good reason to believe it tends to corrupt journalists as well."" [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For her part, Bradlee was adamant that journalists had to stand up to accusations of bias:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"">
<p>""The media has to be careful,"" she said. ""The danger is that, because [Silber] attacks, the media may lay back and not cover him as vigorously as other candidates.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silber's eventual loss to Weld was widely attributed to another ""intemperate"" response to a personal question in a debate [3]--coming from one of Raddatz's colleagues at Boston's WCVB-TV (Channel 5), Natalie Jacobson.</p>

But over and over and over again, during the GOP primary debates, we watched the media obsess over divisive social issues that rank somewhere around zero on the list of voter priorities in this election. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But because most of the corrupt media completely agrees with the far-left on issues ranging from same-sex marriage, abortion on demand, and that only Neanderthals could possibly oppose free contraception for all -- the media then turns these debate moments into The Post-Debate Narrative. Purely by coincidence, no doubt, this tactic fits perfectly into the Obama campaign strategy of divide and conquer, especially when it comes to the women's vote. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Which brings me to today. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">After foolishly running on Big Bird for five days, the Obama campaign made a wicked left-turn this morning with a hastily arranged conference call. You can read about it <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/10/MSM-Obama-Campaign-Collaborate-on-False-Abortion-Attack-on-Romney"">here</a>. The call was all about pushing the media to move The Narrative off of Big Bird and onto abortion. This tells us two things&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">1. The Obama campaign is seeing in its internal polls what public polls are telling us about Romney closing the gender gap. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">2. By pressing this issue the day before the debate, it's obvious the Obama campaign really, really, really wants to have a debate tomorrow that covers social issues. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">How effective could this be for Team Obama if debate moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, complies? &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Let's jump into the wayback machine to January of this year when another ABC News' employee -- former Clinton staffer George Stephanopoulos -- in obvious coordination with the Obama campaign, asked a non-sequitur question that launched a thousand divisive distraction-narratives the media still uses to this day:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Romney, do you believe that states have the right to ban contraception, or is that trumped by a constitutional right to privacy?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">MITT ROMNEY:&nbsp; George, this is an unusual topic that you're raising.&nbsp; States have right to ban contraception?&nbsp; I can't imagine a state banning contraception.&nbsp; I can't imagine the circumstances where a state would want to do so and if I were a governor of a state --</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">STEPHANOPOULOS:&nbsp; The Supreme Court had to rule on this back in 1965 because a state did.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">ROMNEY:&nbsp; -- or a legislature of a state, I would totally and completely oppose any effort to ban contraception. So you're asking -- given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so, and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm asking you, do you believe that states have a right or not to ban contraception?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">ROMNEY:&nbsp; George, I don't know whether a state has a right to ban contraception.&nbsp; No states wants to.&nbsp; I mean, the idea of you putting forward things that states might want to do that no state wants to do, and asking me whether they could do it or not, is kind of a silly thing, I think. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">At the time and at our own peril, we all laughed at Stephanopoulos, who would later claim he asked the question in order to win a bet with Diane Sawyer. But in the wake of Sandra Fluke and Obama forcing Catholic institutions to provide birth control, we now know that the asking of this question was setting the cornerstone of a much, much bigger agenda -- and one beneficial to Obama: REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAT YOUR BIRTH CONTROL!!! </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">It's nonsense, but it can be effective nonsense that at the very least gives the media the reason they so desperately desire to avoid talk about the economy and Libya. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">We're on the edge of a fiscal cliff, the deficit has saddled future generations with a mortgage-sized debt, poverty and gas prices are exploding, and the White House engaged in an obvious cover up of what happened in Libya. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">If Raddatz wants to touch on social issues no one cares about and no president can do much about, that's fine. But everyone watching knows the difference between the pressing issues our time and issues used solely as partisan weaponry to benefit a failed president's reelection.</p>

<p>During the interview,&nbsp;Romney was asked: ""Do you intend to pursue any specific legislation with regard to abortion?""&nbsp;His answer--""There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda""--suggests current, pending legislation. Romney went on to describe his intention to reinstate the Mexico City policy banning foreign aid for organizations that provide abortions abroad.</p>
<p>As the Romney campaign later clarified, the Republican nominee would sign some pro-life legislation. His campaign website indicates that he supports ending federal funding for Planned Parenthood, for example, which provides abortion services, though the organization claims it does not use that funding for abortions.</p>
<p>Yet the Obama campaign had continued to exaggerate Romney's position. On this morning's call, it produced Cecile Richard of Planned Parenthood to verify the claim that Romney wants to ""end Planned Parenthood.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>Richards also attempted to connect Romney with legislation in Congress that he has not, in fact, supported. For example, she pointed to a bill establishing ""personhood"" from conception. In fact, Romney has come <a href=""http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/obama-and-romney-must-choose-sides-in-personhood-debate-as-personhood-oklahoma-supreme-court-challenge-escalates-172374661.html"" target=""_blank"">under fire</a> from pro-life groups for <em>not</em> signing a personhood pledge and <a href=""http://www.christianpost.com/news/personhood-usa-slams-romney-and-ryans-support-of-rape-related-abortions-80409/"" target=""_blank"">supporting abortion in cases of rape</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, the context of the abortion question during the <em>Des Moines Register</em>&nbsp;interview was Romney's answer to a previous question, in which he had been asked to explain why his poll numbers had improved among women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Romney said that it was likely because voters were learning about his real positions, as opposed to those falsely attributed to him by Obama. He singled out false attack ads that suggest he would oppose abortion in the case of rape, incest and if the life of the mother were at risk.</p>
<p>On the conference call, the Obama campaign also highlighted Romney's opposition to the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Roe v. Wade</em>--a decision that could not be overturned by ordinary legislation in any case.</p>
<p>The mainstream media are amplifying the AP story--which is, essentially, about a non-event. Romney said he was not familiar with legislation that he would support, and then promptly named a pro-life policy that he would enact through his executive authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At worst, Romney gave a partial answer. The Obama campaign, understandably (given its circumstances), is trying to amplify that answer into a major debacle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mainstream media are playing along. It was telling that no reporters bothered to challenge the numerous lies and misrepresentations by Cutter and Richard, which were reported verbatim. Instead, they were eager to hear about how this issue might set the stage for tomorrow night's vice presidential debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unable to run on economic policy--and even foreign policy--the Obama campaign is now reaching for social issues, and the media are spoiling for a culture-war fight.

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Is it too much to ask of our corrupt media overlords that if the president of the United States was a guest at one of your staffers weddings that maybe that staffer shouldn't moderate a vice presidential debate? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Obviously it is, because ABC News' senior foreign correspondent, Martha <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_0"">Raddatz</span>, is not only moderating tomorrow night's debate between Paul Ryan and Joe <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_1"">Biden</span>, but no less than Barack Obama was a guest at her 1991 wedding. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The media can never stop <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_2"">crybabying</span> when those of us on the right call them out for their biases, and yet this same crybaby media allows things like this to happen. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Which is worse? The fact that ABC News and <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_3"">Raddatz</span> thought this <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_4"">didn</span>&rsquo;t matter or the fact that they tried to get away with not disclosing an apparent conflict of interest from the start. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">As we've seen with campaign contributions, Fast and Furious, and Libya -- the corrupt media not only believes that presidents with a ""D"" after their name are above transparency, they also seem to believe that they themselves are above transparency. Which is why I consider the media to be most corrupt and dishonest institution allowed to operate legally in America. At least public unions don't claim to be politically objective -- give them that. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_5"">Raddatz</span> is not a journalist on my rather long ""bad guy"" radar. Therefore, she might epitomize all that is bright and beautiful and honorable&nbsp;about the storied profession of journalism. But that <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_7"">doesn</span>&rsquo;t matter. There are plenty of qualified debate moderators, including ABC's own Jake Tapper, respected for their objectivity. (Heaven forbid we jump in the Fox News pool with a <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_8"">Brett</span> <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_9"">Baier</span> or <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_10"">Britt</span> <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_11"">Hume</span>.)</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Granted, twenty years is a long time, but the conflict of interest continues to this day. &nbsp;In 1997, <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_12"">Raddatz</span> divorced the man she married in front of Barack Obama, Julius ""Jay"" <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_13"">Genachowski</span>. But they have a son together and to this very day the father of her child is deeply invested in the Obama Administration as both an appointee and a <span class=""RadEWrongWord"" id=""RadESpellError_14"">fundraiser</span>. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The only institution that looks worse than ABC News (the Daily Caller says the network hasn't exactly been forthcoming about this issue) is the Commission on Presidential Debates. That organization is suspect already among conservatives, but now we know the Commission is either not vetting its moderators or isn't concerned with a glaring conflict of interest. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This is about the future of our country. The ABC network benefits from the public airwaves. Therefore, no detail is too small, no amount of transparency too petty. It's up to us to decide what does and doesnt matter -- the public, the voters, the citizens, and the customers of ABC News. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And to not tell us this only makes us wonder why.</p>

<p>How could Mitt Romney be blasting his way to the top of the polls after just one debate?</p>
<p>Would you like a very simple answer? Here it is: The media tried to tell America that Romney was one thing, while the debate showed them he was another. The difference between the two are seen in the poll numbers. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>For the last year or so the media created a template that reflected their opinion, not reality. Mitt Romney was a gaffe machine who didn't care about people and wasn't intelligent enough to reside within the blinding light of their Dear Leader.</p>
<p>The media has spent this time being dishonest to Americans about Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>I know Mitt Romney and have spent plenty of one-on-one time with him. As a sports reporter I covered the 2002 Olympics and saw first hand his ability to fix things. I had many friends who worked with him and they all came back with the same story. They were amazed at his ability to lead and succeed.</p>
<p>During my times with Romney I have seen him as very personable, approachable, and caring. Yes, caring. Everything the media has told us he is not.</p>
<p>I arrived late to a meeting a couple years ago with a handful of people in the room (yes, I arrived late for a meeting with Romney,) not to worry, with no chairs in the room, Romney quickly stood up and offered me his. A little thing---a personal thing---but it told me a lot about the man.</p>
<p>Yes, Obama was horrible during the Disaster in Denver. He acted like he would've rather been hitting a buried ball out of the sand at the 9th hole at Congressional Country Club (hey Barry, nice recovery!) than actually having to answer Romney's questions about the economy (hey Barry, nice recovery!) But that's just part of the issue here, the bigger issue is that the media told us Romney was something that he is not. The polls reflect the disconnect between what the media told us, and what the people have seen.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href=""http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/did-obama-just-throw-the-entire-election-away.html"">12 point swing in the Pew Poll</a>&nbsp;doesn't happen by accident, it only happens when the media lie to the American people about what a candidate is and they figure out the truth on their own. The debate was Romney unfiltered. Nothing about his performance surprised me, but that night, America finally saw Romney for who he is.</p>
<p>There is still time for the media to turn this election around. Over the next four weeks they will try every trick in the book. The media have too much invested to back up now. Like the cheap, transparent, Vegas magician, you can see the cards up their sleeve and they will pull them out and play them at every turn. It is what it is, except more people are now on to their sleight of hand.</p>

Live with it. Far be it for me to break the unwritten rules that say only ""freaky truthers"" question things like power and our government and polls and counter-intuitive employment statistics released just 30 days before an election.</p>
<p>Nope, not me. </p>
<div></div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those guys.</p>
<p>I want to BELONG. </p>
<p>So rather than question CNN's poll, I'm simply going to report the extraordinary, phenomenal, groundbreaking, breathtaking new numbers found in CNN's just-released poll from the swing state of Ohio:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>Nearly 1/5th of conservatives in Ohio will be voting for Barack Obama. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you believe that? <a href=""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2012/images/10/09/topgenstate4.pdf"">See for yourself</a>. </p>
<p>Well, you have to believe it.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the truth. CNN said so. </p>
<p>There's even bigger news here. While 19% of Ohio conservatives are voting for Obama, only 5% of Republicans are doing the same. Moreover, only 5% of liberals are going to Romney. </p>
<p>Again, I want to repeat that I am not in any way <i>questioning</i> that number, I am merely <i>reporting </i>the extraordinary super-true news CNN just broke, and for some reason (probably humility) isn't calling any attention to. </p>
<p>There's another fascinating number in CNN's Ohio poll. Although many national polls show Romney winning Independents by wide margins and an ARG poll released earlier today showed Romney winning Independents in Ohio <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/09/Romney-Up-in-OH-DPoll"">by a full 20%,</a> CNN has <strong>Obama</strong> winning Ohio Indies by four points, 50-46%. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what to do here. Since creepy truthers are the only ones freakish enough to question poll results, I'm just going to have to assume both polls are correct and that there was a wild 24-point swing among Independents sometime between when these two polls were released, uhm, today.</p>
<p>Now, if some creepy truther did question this CNN poll, though, this certain someone might wonder if perhaps CNN didn&rsquo;t count a few too many Democrats as Independents so that their party ID skew didn&rsquo;t look out of whack. The CNN sample here is 34% D, 34% I, and 32% R -- only a D+2. Hard to argue with that. </p>
<p>But if you push Democrats into the Independent pile, you not only end up with a more reasonable skew that shows Obama winning, you also show Obama winning Independents! </p>
<p>This creepy truther might even go further and say that after three polls released today showed Ohio a statistical tie and Obama below 50%, that a left-wing media operation like CNN planned to drop a poll with screwy numbers and Obama over 50% late in the day in order to set The Narrative for tomorrow's news shows. </p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see anything at all screwy about this CNN poll. </p>
<p>I see only <i>amazing</i> news about Independents and conservatives flocking to Obama. </p>
<p>This poll is as perfect as a jewel. </p>
<p>I want to BELONG.&nbsp;</p>

You rarely see media bias as blatant as you do in a comparison of the following two photos.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney's motorcade was passing Fairfield Elementary School in Virginia when the Governor saw kids waiving and decided to make a U-turn and pull over. The kids were excited to meet Romney, according reporters <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/romney-pop-star-worthy-greeting-school-kids-article-1.1177775"">on the scene</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Are you Mitt Romney?"" asked one awed student.
</p>
<p>
""I am Mitt Romney,"" he replied. ""And that's your governor. That's Governor McDonnell.""</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
""I just saw you on TV!"" exclaimed one little girl who was almost overcome with excitement.</p>
</blockquote>As you can see in this <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/romney-pulls-a-u-ey-to-drop-by-elementary-school/"">ABC video</a>, Romney shook hands with a long line of 4th and 5th graders and got a big ""Thank you"" when he was done. Sometime before leaving, a member of his staff took <a href=""https://twitter.com/Rick_Gorka/status/255357790242078720"">this photo</a>:
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Wrong Dimensions and Stretched Images/Romney Fairfield elementary.jpg"" style=""width: 560px; height: 540px;"" /></p>
<p>Is this a big moment in the race? Of course not. If Romney had kept driving no one would have mentioned it. But it's nice that Romney pulled over and spent a few minutes with the kids. It humanizes him and makes him even seem sort of likable.</p>
<p>Enter the AP's Evan Vucci. </p>
<p>Just before the previous image was taken, AP photographer Vucci snapped a shot of Romney mid-crouch. The girl behind him is looking at something in surprise which we can't see from this angle. But it looks like, well, like she's staring at his butt:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" height=""376"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Wrong Dimensions and Stretched Images/AP Romney Fairfield Elementary.jpg"" width=""512"" /></p>
<p>So instead of a nice moment, which this actually was for the kids and for Mitt Romney, we now have an embarrassing photo guaranteed to make an appearance on Gawker. But not just at Gawker. It was the highlighted photo of the day <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/10/today-in-pictures-mitt-romney-tar-heels-football-somali-fighter/"">at ABC</a>. It was the top of the otherwise favorable story at the <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/romney-pop-star-worthy-greeting-school-kids-article-1.1177775"">NY Daily News</a>. It appeared on the websites of <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=Republican presidential candidate%2C former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney poses for photographs with students of Fairfield Elementary School&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsuo&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=nws&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hF10UJTUMJCWjAL3pICwAg&amp;ved=0CCwQqAI&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=12c0c745ef3dc205&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1000"">local papers</a> around the country.</p>
<p>After some criticism from Newsbusters and others, the AP has now issued a response. Rather than pull the photo, they are <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/ap-criticizes-over-a-romney-photo/2012/10/09/97c71f3e-1225-11e2-ba83-a7a396e6b2a7_blog.html"">adding this</a> to the caption:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think anyone who took a moment to think about it realized that's what was happening. But that misses the point entirely. This was a gag photo designed to embarrass Romney.

The Obama campaign is panicking, the Romney campaign is emboldened, and even the media has been forced to declare the race a toss-up. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Moreover, every historical measurement, from unemployment to income to gas prices, spell trouble for the incumbent. Therefore, there's absolutely no question in the minds of any objective person, left or right, that the right race is up for grabs and the momentum is with the GOP nominee.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><img alt="""" height=""356"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2012/10/09/snake oil.png"" width=""473"" /></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And yet, in the middle of it all, we have one desperate, bleary-eyed ObamaTruther: Five Thirty Eight's Nate Silver. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">From his lofty perch at <i>the New York Times,</i> it is apparently Silver's job to -- not eflect reality -- but to use some super-duper secret sauce that runs Objective Reality through a left-wing number cruncher, and sprinkles it with happy dust in order to reassure bubbled liberals everywhere that Obama's <i>going to be okay. </i></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">At least I'm assuming that's Nate Silver's raison d'etre, because there's absolutely no other way to explain how any intellectually honest analyst who's crunching the latest poll numbers (which Silver is) &nbsp;could possibly have Romney's chances of victory sitting at &hellip; 25.2%.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Earlier this morning, Silver spent over <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/oct-8-a-great-poll-for-romney-in-perspective/#more-35748"">1500 words explaining</a> that number. I read it all. It makes absolutely no sense. Unless&hellip;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">You see, Silver's over-arching job really isn't to analyze numbers; and in all seriousness, it's not to make Upper Westside liberals feel better (though that's certainly a by-product). What Silver really is, is a Narrative Creator. Silver poses as an objective independent analyst and then uses an impressive-looking but completely ridiculous number-crunching formula as a way to keep things looking up for Obama. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Perception is crucial in politics, and if Silver can always be there for the media, &nbsp;the media has something to look to so they can always be there for Obama. Like almost everything else the media does, it's all a hustle, a scam, a juiced-number conspiracy that allows the media to <b>not</b> write stories about Obama The Loser -- which would be devastating. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And it doesn&rsquo;t matter that today Nate Silver jumped the shark with his ridiculous 25.2% prediction of a Romney victory. Because Silver doesn&rsquo;t exist in order to give anyone intelligent analysis. He's there to make Obama boosterism look intelligent and thoughtful and fact-based, no matter how ridiculous and counter-intuitive and fantastic the end result. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And yet, people take Nate Silver seriously and still will even after today. Part of it is willful ignorance; part of it is out of necessity to boost Obama; and part of it are those dumb enough to still be impressed by the mantle of the New York Times. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">But make no mistake, Nate Silver is pure snake oil salesman, no better than a Politico or BuzzFeed Politics. Actually, he's closer to these lying media fact-checkers that hide behind manufactured facts. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The only difference is that Silver's spin and bias and lies of omission are hidden behind math. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no question that The Biggest Political Story Of The Day (maybe of the campaign yet) is Romney's comeback in almost every poll-- and yet, this is Politico's front page today:</p>

<p>Politico's gone from being dishonest and biased to just plain ole' pathetic. </p>
<p>Why would left-wingers even read this junk? If you can't click on the front page and get a sense of the where the race is at four weeks out, what good is a site named Politico? </p>
<p>It's one thing for the corrupt Politico to attempt to control reality. It's quite another to stand before an elephant and ask, ""What elephant?""</p>
<p>The Internet is laughing at Politico today. Never has a site with so much promise worked so hard to marginalize itself.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">A media that is obviously disappointed with Their Precious One's debate performance and recent collapse in the polls is not at all happy with this silly and stupid Big Bird attack. Politico criticized the ad <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/chicago-gets-serious-137848.html"">as small ball</a>, NBC News described it as ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsNkZ5FHvRQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"">absurd</a>,"" &nbsp;and ABC's Rick Klein seems <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/one-month-to-go-and-the-polls-they-are-a-changin-the-note/"">confused by the desperate smallness of it</a>:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Team Obama makes a play using &hellip; Big Bird? The new Obama campaign ad uses a mock-serious tone to jump on Mitt Romney&rsquo;s most famous debate line. It&rsquo;s all in good fun, but the contrast may not be what President Obama is after, not now, not in this race. Romney is getting more serious by the day, with a foreign-policy speech and now Paul Ryan about to make the case for conservative fiscal policies. Romney marches toward Benghazi, while the president marches down Sesame Street?</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Even MSNBC's Chuck Todd <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMaFSNzM1nE&amp;feature=youtu.be"">criticized the ad</a>: ""When is the Obama campaign going to stop talking about the debate? &hellip; They cannot seem to turn the page from the debate. ... Any conversation about that debate, I assume, helps Mitt Romney.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This is something we see very rarely in our corrupt media, a backlash against an obvious attempt by the Obama campaign to create a distraction from the big issues of the day. Obviously, in the face of falling poll numbers and Romney's well-received foreign policy speech yesterday, Obama's Media Palace Guards just don&rsquo;t see ""absurd"" distractions as good strategy at the exact time Romney is looking more and more presidential. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">With middle class incomes deflating, four Americans recently assassinated by al-Qaeda, poverty and gas prices increasing, and the debt already saddling our children and grandchildren with mortgage-sized debt, Americans aren&rsquo;t likely&nbsp; to be any more enamored than the media with Obama's non-stop ""smallness.""</p>

</p>
<p>Since last Wednesday's debate, many voices have dismissed its importance saying that, historically, debates haven't really been much of a factor. But the left's incessant gnashing of teeth over Obama's crash and burn has certainly magnified his poor performance and made that assumption far less axiomatic.
</p>
<p>Wednesday's debate was seen by a record number of viewers, too. 67.2 million viewers saw Obama self-destruct that night, so add that to this week-long post debate hand wringing by liberal commentators and it has definitely spread that misery to untold millions more.
</p>
<p>But, Sullivan's October 8 meltdown is one for the books. One can just <em>feel</em> Sullivan's despair, a rage that must have been building for nearly a week. But what finally set Sullivan off was the newest <a href=""http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/08/romneys-strong-debate-performance-erases-obamas-lead/"">Pew poll</a> that shows that Romney has totally erased Obama's lead with but that one performance.
</p>
<p>""Obama's performance gave Romney a 12 point swing! I repeat: a 12 point swing,"" Sullivan cried.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romney's favorables are above Obama's now. Yes, you read that right. Romney's favorables are higher than Obama's right now. That gender gap that was Obama's firewall? Over in one night...
</p>
<p>Seriously: has that kind of swing ever happened this late in a campaign? Has any candidate lost 18 points among women voters in one night ever? And we are told that when Obama left the stage that night, he was feeling good. That's terrifying.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of reporting Pew&rsquo;s polling results, Sullivan also slammed the president for his disinterest in the whole deal of preparing for the debates.
</p>
<p>Sullivan carped that, despite all the many people that came to his aide to shore him up -- such as the whole of the media and even Bill Clinton &ndash; Obama has frittered it all away with a casual disregard for his ""responsibilities."" In fact, Sullivan ruefully notes, Obama was even heard to complain about having to ""do his homework"" studying for the debate.
</p>
<p>This disinterest in his duty to prepare himself for the debates left Sullivan apoplectic. ""Too arrogant to take a core campaign responsibility seriously. Too arrogant to give his supporters what they deserve,"" he exploded.
</p>
<p>Sullivan is worried that Obama will simply ""look desperate"" if he tries to point out that Romney is a liar after that horrid debate, but the blogger is still trying to ""rally some morale"" for the President, anyway. But he sure seems despondent.
</p>
<p>""... when a president self-immolates on live TV, and his opponent shines with lies and smiles, and a record number of people watch, it's hard to see how a president and his party recover,"" Sullivan sobs.
</p>
<p>Oh, the humanities.

<p>CNN announced on Monday the network is <a href=""http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/08/cnn-announces-creation-of-cnn-films/"">starting</a>&nbsp;a documentary films unit that will produce feature-length documentaries that ""will examine an array of political, social, and economic subject matters.""</p>
<p>The unit will be called ""CNN Films"" and will secure rights to documentaries for air on CNN. These films will be targeted for broader theatrical release.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CNN Films will bring distinguished, thought-provoking documentary programming to our global audiences on all our television, online and mobile platforms,&rdquo; said Whitaker. &ldquo;We want these documentaries to tell compelling stories and stimulate important discussions across CNN&rsquo;s other programs and websites.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""p1"">CNN Films' first documentary will be ""Girl Rising,"" which will air in the spring of 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p1"">The film includes voice performances by Academy Award Winners Meryl Streep,&nbsp;Academy Award Nominee&nbsp;Anne Hathaway,&nbsp;Kerry Washington, and&nbsp;Selena Gomez and is&nbsp;directed by Academy Award Nominee Richard E. Robbins.</p>
<p class=""p1"">CNN Films has also signed development deals with Academy Award Winning Director and Producer Alex Gibney (&ldquo;Taxi to the Dark Side,&rdquo; &ldquo;Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer&rdquo;) and Director Andrew Rossi (&ldquo;Page One: Inside the New York Times&rdquo;).&nbsp; Both will develop original documentaries to air on CNN.</p>

</p>
<p>Citizen journalists aren't trained well enough to be trusted as a source of news, Safer <a href=""http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/308039-1"">declared</a> to CSPAN's Brian Lamb on Sept. 13.
</p>
<p>In fact, he's downright ""appalled"" by the whole idea of Internet journalism and seems to wish it would all just go away. We need to leave the ""reporting"" to him and his professional class of ""real"" journalists, Safer sonorously declared.</p>
<p>
The question about citizen journalism was put to Safer after Lamb showed the aged newsman a clip of former Daily Caller correspondent Michelle Fields. On the clip, Fields was seen celebrating the advent of the new media.
</p>
<p>Safer, a Canadian, admitted that he ""sounds like a Neanderthal"" with his hatred of citizen journalism -- which, he said, he'd trust as much as he'd trust ""a citizen surgeon"" -- nonetheless he rejects the idea that mere citizens can be a legitimate source of news reporting.
</p>
<p>Safer's arrogance is rich. First of all, to equate journalism to the art and decades of training it takes to make a surgeon is a hilarious conceit. But to imagine that only his professional class should be considered ""real"" journalists is wholly ignorant of most of the true history of journalism in America. Few of the most famous journalists had what Safer would call the ""proper"" training to become journalists. In fact, journalism schools are a rather new invention, relatively speaking, and may soon be a curriculum of the past if the trend of <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/09/17/One-Down-Emory-University-to-End-Journalism-Program"">eliminating such programs</a> continues in our universities.
</p>
<p>Of course, Safer is correct that the job of an editor is important whether for all those ""real journalists"" or otherwise. But having an editor is no guarantee that an end product will be ""real reporting,"" either. <a href=""http://www.conservapedia.com/Rathergate"">Just ask Safer's colleague, Dan Rather</a>!
</p>
<p>But really, all one needs for good journalism is a competent writer and a dedication to the truth. Like anything, there are skills the job requires and certainly not <em>everybody</em> has those skills. But Safer&rsquo;s contention that only his approved class of &ldquo;real journalists&rdquo; should be allowed to deliver the news is simply arrogance beyond belief.
</p>
<p>In fact, one reason&nbsp;his preferred system was built was to skew the ""news"" in a particular political direction. Long ago Safer's beloved profession went from being a straight forward reporting the news to an effort at creating the news. The tightly controlled -- and now disappearing &ndash; media establishment Safer is hanging onto was made to screen out any opposing ideas just as much as it was to professionalize the end product.
</p>
<p>Of course, Safer's whole mien is self-serving. He was once one of those ""real reporters"" that was the gatekeeper of all that is ""news."" Now his monopoly has been shattered and his control of the media no longer a lock. It is natural to decry the loss of such supreme power. Who wouldn't long for the good old days in such a situation?
</p>
<p>In the end, he may be more like a dinosaur than a Neanderthal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Brian Lamb:</strong> Reaction, sir.
</p>
<p><strong>Morley Safer:</strong> Appalled. I'm appalled! I mean I don't know quite if she thinks this is a good idea? Uh...
</p>
<p><strong>Lamb:</strong> Uh, no, she does.
</p>
<p><strong>Safer:</strong> She <em>does</em> think it's a good idea.
</p>
<p><strong>Lamb:</strong> Yeah
</p>
<p><strong>Safer:</strong> I think it's a dreadful idea. I mean, journalism, good journalism, good reporting must work within the constraints of great editing. It <em>has</em> to.
</p>
<p>I got in trouble a couple of years ago. I was making a speech, I got some award in Canada, and I was talking about the so-called citizen journalism. And I said I would trust citizen journalism as much as I would trust a citizen surgeon.
</p>
<p>You <em>need</em> to work within discipline, within certain disciplines. And, uh, I think the Matt Drudges and these and many of these others give the <em>real thing</em> a very bad name. Because now everybody's on the Internet. I mean, and, one of the problems I have with the Internet in terms of reading... everything looks as valid as The New York Times. Whether it's the typeface, the way its been set up. So, whether you're reading some, somebody who, you know, believes aliens are out to get him, or reading something from the oped pages of The New York Times. It all has the same look, the same, makes the same visual sense. And, um, I know I'm sounding like a Neanderthal when I say this, but, uh, I'm just appalled by half the stuff that I see on the Internet.

<p>In an interview with Brian Wilson, Bryan Nehman and Larry O'Connor on WMAL's ""Morning's on the Mall"" Mrs. Romney acknowledged that after the 2008 campaign for the GOP nomination she said she would never go through the process again. &nbsp;Part of the reason for her reluctance to re-enter the political arena was the harsh and dishonest treatment from the press, according to Mrs. Romney. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Asked about the media's treatment of Gov. Romney compared to their coverage of President Obama, Mrs. Romney said, ""Whenever you're in politics you know it's never going to be fair.""</p>

The new headline is still misleading and the story itself is still complete garbage, but now a little less so.</em></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">While Governor Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech received all kinds of praise from supporters, even those like the <i>Weekly Standard's</i> Bill Kristol who have not been shy about publicly criticizing the GOP nominee, leave it up to the corrupt Politico to come rushing to Obama's aid with this headline:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;""><a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=3E57ED76-78A8-46C4-A9D1-2680A775F052"">Experts pan Romney foreign policy speech</a></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">The piece is from Josh Gerstein, who was obviously very careful about which ""experts"" he chose to talk with. If there's a better 2012 example of a so-called journalist desperate to find a desired outcome, I have yet to see it. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In order to publish that headline (which is the only thing the corrupt Politico cared about), Gerstein published the opinions of exactly three so-called ""experts,"" two of whom are open partisans:</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Madeleine Albright: Secretary of State under Obama booster Bill Clinton. </p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>James Lindsay: <a href=""http://www.cfr.org/experts/us-foreign-policy-congress-president-politics/james-m-lindsay/b2719/bio"">A former Clinton staffer</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third is:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>Steve Rosen, a former senior official at the American Israel Public Affairs Council. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So two partisans and one pro-Israel advocate results in a blazing Politico headline that reads:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>Experts pan Romney foreign policy speech</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Politico is the hackiest hack in all of hack-dom. The dregs of the left-wing journalism world and much more concerned with being featured a hundred times a day on MSNBC than doing anything resembling telling the truth. </p>

Apparently, two of America's most dishonest and disreputable journalists are pretty upset over the fact that Americans no longer trust the government and the media. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">This Sunday on ""Meet the Press,"" Todd was all pained over *gasp* Americans' growing suspicion that a government institution would release counter-intuitive unemployment numbers beneficial to the president just 30 days out from an election. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">According to the Huffington Post, at times Todd was so upset, his voice ""<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/08/chuck-todd-conspiracy-theories-corroding-government_n_1947731.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003&amp;ir=Politics"">grew shaky</a>"":&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Todd interrupted. ""This is really making me crazy,"" he said. ""The Federal Reserve gets questioned now for politics these days, the Supreme Court, John Roberts. We have corroded.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in;"">Todd lowered his voice, which grew shaky. ""What we're doing, we're corroding trust in our government in a way, and one time responsible people are doing to control it. And the idea that Donald Trump and Jack Welch, rich people with crazy conspiracy, can get traction on this, is a bad trend.""</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">First off, why would we trust any institution with someone as dishonest as a Chuck Todd for a&nbsp; character witness? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Chuck Todd isn't just a bad or biased journalist. He never stops lying through omission (just watch his deplorable MSNBC show), he <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/09/12/Chuck-Todd-Mind-Reader"">makes things up</a>, <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/17/chuck-todd-encourages-occupiers-and-glitterbombers-while-somehow-blaming-their-behavior-on-the-republicans-theyre-attacking/"">encourages Occupy protests against Republicans</a>, and is <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/08/29/NBC-Whites-Only-Speech-Policy"">a despicable race-baiter</a>. But what it all boils down to is that Todd is a Palace Guard for The State. And because Democrats and, more specifically, Barack Obama, worship The State, Todd also sees it as his mission to protect them at all costs -- even the truth. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Just the fact that Todd is an elite member of the very profession that should be most skeptical of governmental institutions, but instead gets ""shaky"" over the fact that others are skeptical of it, is highly revealing. In just a few sentences Sunday, Todd bares a soul that reveals his true agenda: to protect The State. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Todd is also too stupid to understand that his unwillingness to question and investigate Obama's government has a lot to do with America's growing distrust in it. No one trusts that which isn&rsquo;t being watch-dogged. As overheated as the media was to nail Bush, we could at least rest easy in the knowledge his government was being watched. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">It's just a fact that today our corrupt media is infinitely more interested in Romney's taxes than <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/10/08/Report-Illegal-Foreign-Campaign-Donations-Assault-on-American-Sovereignty"">the hundreds of millions of unreported donations Obama's hauling in</a>; statements by Todd Akin get a hundred-times the coverage of Fast and Furious; the timing of something Romney said is a bigger story than security lapses in Libya and the ensuing cover up; our failing economy gets less coverage than Romney's real and invented gaffes; the president's <a href=""http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/10/02/Obama-Speech-Hampton"">despicable race-baiting</a> in '07 is written off as old news by the same corrupt media that attacked Romney for cutting a guy's hair 50 years ago. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Hey, Chuck, don't cry. You simply cannot expect us to trust a government whose watch dogs have been so obviously bought off and co-opted. </p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Again, why would anyone believe in any&nbsp; institution with someone as unscrupulous as Ben Smith for a character witness? </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Other than the corrupt Politico, over the last four or five years, <strong>no one </strong>has done more to destroy journalism than the BenSmithiest BenSmither in the history of BenSmithing -- Ben Smith. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Smith's entire reason for being -- &nbsp;which is now on steroids with his staff of BenSmithers-in-training -- is to kill anti-Obama narratives and to troll Romney and Republicans to death with nonsense-distractions. Ben Smith isn't just a degenerate left-winger who disguises himself as a ""journalist"" -- from an objective viewpoint he's helped make journalism even smaller and more petty than it already was. Smith is only about amplifying and weaponizing The Stupid and Meaningless to damage Republicans and protect Democrats. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">One of Smith's primary calling cards at BuzzFeed is dredging up old videos of politicians, and yet he was among the first to call Obama's 2007 race-baiting video ""old news."" Rather than take even a few minutes to question Friday's jobs numbers, Smith's BenSmithers ran <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/jack-welch-tells-twitterverse-hes-not-old-or"">this headline</a> against one of the most respected CEO's in American history because he dared to. <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/senators-demand-village-voice-adult-services-site"">This</a> is bigger news than Obama's 2007 race-baiting, and until an update (that was really a correction) was added -- this <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/romney-mistates-reason-for-unemployment-rate-drop"">was a bald-faced lie</a>. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">And those examples above are just from last week. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">I could go back in time and run out of Internet detailing Smith's smallness, trolling, lies, and Palace Guarding. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Ben Smith is the Lex Luthor of dishonestly bad journalism, the arch-villain of everything wrong with the media today. And now he's all anguished over the pile of rubble his work and example created. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">In the end, it's kind of nice to see Todd and Smith reduced to whining, especially when you consider the fact that they&rsquo;re really not pleading for us to trust government and media. What they want is for us to again trust them -- their biased reporting, dishonest polls, and who they are as men. </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">Well, I've got a couple tips for them&hellip;.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">1. If these two shills want us to trust government again, I suggest they start holding government accountable regardless of which party sits in the Oval Office. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"">2. If these two hacks want us to trust the media again, they can start by looking for another line of work. </p>

Milbank cited the lack of solo press conferences Obama has held along with the ""yes men"" that surrounding the President. But he forgot to mention that his cohorts in the mainstream press have also been ""yes men"" and ""lapdogs"" throughout Obama's first term in office and deserve an equal amount of blame as Obama. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Milbank wrote ""Obama received a valuable reminder in his drubbing at Wednesday night&rsquo;s debate: He is a president, not a king.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What Milbank fails to note, is the pro-Obama mainstream media has been complicit in treating Obama like a king, making him feel even more entitled to think of himself as one. On the budget, debt, Libya, Obama's failed campaign promises, scandals such as Fast and Furious, crony capitalism boondoggles like Solyndra, and a host of other issues, the mainstream press given Obama a pass, refusing to demand press conferences and help put public pressure on the Obama administration to hold more solo press conferences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Towson University political scientist Martha Kumar keeps a running tally of Obama&rsquo;s media appearances and told Milbank Obama has had ""19 solo news conferences in the White House as of Sept. 30. That compares to 26 for Ronald Reagan at the same point in his presidency, 59 for George H.W. Bush, and 31 for Bill Clinton.""<br />
</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">""But Obama has only himself to blame, because he set himself up for Wednesday&rsquo;s emperor-has-no-clothes moment,"" Milbank writes. ""For the past four years, he has worked assiduously to avoid being questioned, maintaining a regal detachment from the media and other sources of dissent and skeptical inquiry.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Milbank notes ""Obama is surrounded by a large number of yes men who aren&rsquo;t likely to get in his face"" and this ""insularity led directly to the Denver debacle.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""Obama was out of practice and unprepared to be challenged. The White House had supposed that Obama&rsquo;s forays into social media &mdash; town hall meetings with YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and the like &mdash; would replace traditional presidential communication. By relying on such venues, Obama&rsquo;s argument skills atrophied, and he was ill-equipped to engage in old-fashioned give and take.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""></span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Milbank writes Obama ""hasn&rsquo;t held a full-fledged news conference at the White House since March"" and ""in lieu of taking hard questions, Obama has opted for gauzy, soft-focus interviews"" with ""Entertainment Tonight"" and radio hosts like the ""Pimp With The Limp.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Tough questions are rare in one-on-one interviews, because Obama has more control over the topic &mdash; and the interviewer wants to be invited back,"" Milbank wrote, noting Obama&rsquo;s body language during the debate ""conveyed a sense that he felt it beneath him to be sharing a stage with Romney.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">The mainstream media is notably upset and perturbed Romney shellacked Obama during their first debate, but the irony is that the mainstream media's coddling of Obama set Obama up for failure when Romney held Obama to account -- perhaps for the first time during Obama's four years in office -- for his failed policies and record.&nbsp;</p><img height=""1"" src=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BigJournalism/~4/LiDWa7drG5A"" width=""1"" />"

<td>The amount of damage being inflicted on countries around the world by bad economic policy is astounding. As a result of unemployment or underemployment, millions of people are seeing their lives ruined. The current policies have led to trillions of dollars of lost output. From an economic standpoint this loss is every bit as devastating as if a building had been destroyed by tanks or bombs. And people have lost their lives, due to inadequate health care, food and shelter, or as a result of the depression associated with their grim economic fate.<br />

<br />
If an enemy had inflicted this much damage on the United States, the countries of the European Union, or the countries elsewhere in the world that have been caught up in this downturn, millions of people would be lining up to enlist in the military, anxious to avenge this outrage. But, there is no external enemy to blame. The villains are the economists, still mostly men, in business suits. [...]
<p>The economists in policy positions are doing their best to convince the public that the economic catastrophe that they are living through is a natural disaster that is beyond human control. But that is what Vice President Biden would call ?malarkey.? This is a disaster that is 100 percent human caused and is being perpetuated by bad policy.</p>
<p>The original collapse was the result of central bankers who were at best asleep at the wheel, or at worst complicit in the financial sectors? wheeling and dealing, ignoring the risks that massive housing bubbles obviously posed to the economy. However the response to the downturn has made a bad situation far worse than necessary. [...]</p>
<p>The right-wing politicians and their allied economists can repeat all the nonsense the like about promoting business confidence and tax breaks for job creators, but there is no remotely plausible story in which it would be possible to generate enough demand from investment to make up for the demand lost from the collapse of the bubbles.</p>
<p>This means that in the short-term the only way to make up the demand is from the government budget deficits. This is not even economic theory, it is simply accounting.<br /></p>

<p>Nothing can get under his skin. Nothing. No attack can cause him to lose his equilibrium, to cause him to squint or gawp or stare like McCain seems to do three times every minute. Barack Obama is a fundamentally cool cat?and that's one of the reasons he's not just going to win this election, but win big.

With about three weeks until election day, and <b>43</b> polls in the hopper from this weekend and Monday, we can draw a few very tenuous conclusions about the state of play in the 2012 election cycle:
<ul>
<li>The presidential race has moved clearly back into a very competitive position, although President Obama <strong>may</strong> have gotten finally stalled the Romney momentum on the polling front over this weekend.</li>
<li>Conversely, the GOP's fortunes on the Senate front seem to be getting worse, with it now looking just as likely that the Democrats will <i>gain</i> seats in the upper chamber than they are to lose the Senate altogether.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the House is the great ""unfigurable"" body in this election. Right now, it looks highly unlikely that the Democrats can find the two-dozen-plus pickups they will need, especially in light of the handful of districts they seem certain to lose back to the GOP. However, the scant amount of data does hint that there may be enough districts in play to make it interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, with just 22 days to go. the only thing certain about the 2012 election cycle is that virtually <i>nothing</i> is for certain.</p>
<p>More on that later. For now, on to the numbers:</p>

This makes me very, very sad. Apparently we have a bit of a villager revolt on our hands, in the form of <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/15/let-candy-crowley-moderate/"">an argument over what role moderator Candy Crowley will have in the debate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he legal teams for President Obama and Mitt Romney ? in a rare moment of bipartisanship ? have complained to the Commission on Presidential Debates regarding moderator <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/15/both-sides-worried-that-candy-crowley-will-ask-questions/"">Candy Crowley?s assertions that she plans to follow up on questions asked by the town hall audience</a>.</blockquote>
Yes, this is a thing now. So what's going on is that Crowley said she intends to take a rather more active role than first envisioned or planned for; in her words:<br />
<blockquote>In a debate, you don?t want to go over plowed ground. [?] I?m always kind of looking for the next question ? So there?s opportunity for follow-up to kind of get them to drill down on the subjects that these folks want to learn about in the town hall.</blockquote>
The campaigns expressed skepticism. More importantly, the debate commission itself expressed skepticism, because Crowley seemed to imply she would be altering the actual guidelines the debate commission set forth when preparing for the town hall?for better or for worse, those guidelines explicitly say things like ""the moderator will not ask follow-up questions or comment on either the questions asked by the audience or the answers of the candidates,"" suggesting the role of moderator in this town hall could just as well have been served by some intern, somewhere, if we were being honest about it. It then took the villager's villager, Mark Halperin, to ""<a href=""http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/14/moderator-role-under-scrutiny-before-the-debate/#ixzz29NnR8CYR"">break the story</a> of all this skeptical skepticism taking place, because there is nothing more goddamn interesting to the village than villagers talking about villagers, and now it's a thing. Well, a little thing, anyway.

That's the 38-year-old son of Tommy Thompson, Republican candidate for Senate in Wisconsin, telling a Republican crowd at a campaign luncheon for his father that they can ""send President Obama back to Chicago?or Kenya.""

And no one seemed to think it was worth a heads up to Thompson the elder, who was not at the event, what was said.

<blockquote>?The Governor has addressed this with his son, just like any father would do,? the campaign said in a statement. ?Jason Thompson said something he should not have, and he apologizes.?</blockquote>
As if Thompson's son was an errant teenager, not a middle-aged official surrogate for his father. No denunciation of birtherism, no actual words of apology from Jason Thompson, no statement from Preibus denouncing the remarks, and no statement from Tommy Thompson denying he's a birther, too. Just a stern, and apparently private, parental lecture.
<p>That's just not good enough.</p>

Hello, human diary. It is I again, Mitt Romney, your better.
<p>I am currently preparing for tomorrow night's debate. As I understand it, the premise of this debate is that the commoners themselves will ask questions of me. This seems highly irregular (typically, the proper response to commoners asking questions is to summon security), but seems to be an expected part of the process. No matter; I still have a great many zinged statements that I did not get to use during the previous debate, most of which can be repurposed towards commoners if need be. I have found commoners to be no brighter than press units, in general: As experiment, I have been alternately promising to cut all taxes and promising that taxes will not be cut, depending on who is asking, and as far as I can discern there is not one person in the nation who has noticed the contradiction.</p>
<p>Speaking of commoners, Mini-Mitt told me that he had recently volunteered at a kitchen for soups. He said it was very arduous work, and that even the clean dishes there were very dirty, forcing him to wash them again because, he said, commoners are well known for not being very good at washing things. This is curious, as I have generally found cleaning things (dishes, cars, houses and the like) to be one of the few things commoners are successful at. (Commoners excel at yard work?I cannot stress enough how very much they seem to enjoy such tasks.) Perhaps there is opportunity here to bring up my tax plan again? If we reduce taxes on wealthy Americans, wealthy Americans will be able to acquire more things; they will then be obliged to hire commoners to come clean those additional things, which will create more commoner jobs in the field of cleaning things. Yes, I will definitely have to remember that for tomorrow night.</p>
<p>I do not have much else to report, Mr. Diary. I have been feeling better about the campaign of late, primarily because I have had to do very little actual campaigning. Most of my time is spent now in fundraisers, which are far more enjoyable than giving speeches to commoners. The enjoyable part about fundraisers is that individuals are assigned seats strictly in accordance with their wealth, with more financially successful individuals nearer the front and lesser wealth units towards the back, in table-by-table gradations. This immediately makes clear who ought to be paid attention to, and in what proportions. It is simple, straightforward and effective. If only the rest of this silly process could be as efficient!<br /></p>

Here's the latest ad spending figures from last week:<br />
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
Despite all the brave talk about Michigan and Pennsylvania being in play, fact is no one has spent a dime there in a long time. No state is truly competitive unless money is being spent. And if Mitt Romney were to win Michigan, or President Barack Obama Arizona, lots of other states would have already delivered the winning margin.
<p>New Hampshire was an odd one?getting minimal spending from both sides. It doesn't look like Romney internals are giving them much hope there. They're spending just enough to keep a foot in the door, but there's no outright push for the state.</p>
<p>The opposite goes for Obama in North Carolina, where less than a million means they're not feeling too optimistic about winning it on the air. On the other hand, Republicans rightfully see it as a must-win, and are outspending Obama 4-1 in the state.</p>
<p>$12 million was spent cumulatively in both Florida and Ohio last week. Sucks to be them. Virginia wasn't far behind, with Team Red spending more in that state than any other.</p>
<p>In all, Republicans outspent us in every state except for Nevada. An argument can be made that this could be fueling some of Romney's gains the past week. Personally, I think it was all debate, since this crazy level of ad spending hasn't moved numbers before. I doubt they're really moving numbers now. But, of course, I have no way to test my hypothesis.</p>
<p>One thing I do know?they may be outspending us, but that doesn't mean voters are <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82217.html"">seeing more Republican ads</a>:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Voters in Columbus, Ohio, saw 30-second television ads for both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney while watching ?Wheel of Fortune? on their CBS affiliate over three days in September. For Obama?s team, the order per spot cost $500. For Romney?s, the price tag on the order was more than five times steeper at $2,800 per ad.<br />
That gap ? found in data filed with the Federal Communications Commission ? is an outgrowth of an unusual TV-buying strategy by the Romney campaign. Media strategists on both sides of the political aisle, along with station managers who handle ad placement, expressed puzzlement to POLITICO about the way Romney?s TV operation does business.</blockquote>
More examples, because this is nuts:<br />
<blockquote>According to available data, during the Emmy Awards on Sept. 23, both Obama and Romney purchased a 30-second ad during the 8-11 p.m. time block on WCPO, the ABC affiliate in Cincinnati, Ohio. Obama?s team paid $1,200 for its 30-second ad; Romney?s team paid $3,600 for its ad in the same time slot. The Obama team booked the ad on Sept. 11; Romney?s team booked it on Sept. 18.
<p>On WEWS, the ABC affiliate in Cleveland, Ohio, Obama?s campaign paid $175 per 30-second spot on Good Morning America, during the 7-9 a.m. time slot, for the week of Sept. 12 to Sept. 18. Romney?s team paid $500 for an ad on GMA during the same time slot on the same dates. And on the local 6 p.m. news that week, Obama paid $400 for a 30-second spot; Romney paid $1,100. Obama?s ads were part of a month-long buy, from Sept. 4 to Oct. 1, while Romney?s were for Sept. 12 to Sept. 18.</p>
</blockquote>
So the only factor at play isn't the amount spent, but the competence of the campaign buying the ads. In this case, we've got the better end of that deal.
<p>One last note?the Koch Brothers, via their Super PAC Americans for Prosperity, are no longer playing at the presidential level. Their last ad hitting Obama came the second week of September. They've been off the air ever since, refocusing their efforts in state-level races where they clearly hope to get a bigger bang for their bucks.</p>

<blockquote>Romney aides told BuzzFeed their polling indicates that Obama's biggest vulnerability among Hispanics is that he's viewed as a ""weak leader."" In much of Latino culture, they explained, political leaders are expected to demonstrate a macho bravado, and Obama's debate performance last month ? with his verbal pauses, downward gaze, and weak defense of his own record ? seemed to exacerbate the incumbent's perception problem.</blockquote>
This, coming from the same crowd that cried about Joe Biden being too assertive, mean, and well, ""macho"", to Mitt Romney's intern Paul Ryan.
<p>President Barack Obama is down with Florida Latinos in some recent polling, yes. In fact, he's down with everyone. That's the legacy of his first debate. The notion that there's a cultural factor at play is ludicrous. Indeed, the broader trends remain: Romney <a href=""http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/10/15/obama-slightly-down-among-latinos-post-debate-but-romney-stuck-in-low-20s/"">significantly lags with Latinos</a> because he's horrible on the issues they care about:<br /></p>
<blockquote>President Obama slipped from 72% last week to 67% this week, suggesting that his debate performance also led some Latino voters to re-evaluate the President. Those who said they are certain to vote for Romney increased slightly from 20% last week to 23% this week.</blockquote>

Does that mean that Obama can rest easy? Of course not. He needs to use tomorrow's debate to speak to Latinos about the things they care about. But if Obama was culturally unacceptable to Latinos then, well, he'd be sitting at 23 percent of their support.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Republicans tried but failed in all but two states to keep newly minted Libertarian Gary Johnson off the ballot.</div>
</div>
The worry in the Mitt Romney camp is that in a few close must-have states such as Florida, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson could draw a tiny percentage of the vote, but enough to give President Obama the edge. That's <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/us/politics/gary-johnson-the-libertarian-partys-presidential-nominee-worries-republicans.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;hp&quot;&quot;"">why the party</a> fought so hard to keep Johnson off the ballot in several states, including Pennsylvania, where Team Johnson <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/05/gary-johnsons-campaign-says-gop-committed-crimes-to-keep-him-off-ballot/?fb_action_ids=4673134794300&amp;fb_action_types=og.recommends&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582#access_token=AAAAAIWijSp4BAKwdzRZBvSSKzOP8y44RNMC81BOZCRZAkpxqgTfiVpeHs5hTIdqnsokcwOhNc3ArPPgKH99kZCKN7FtjlvmyZBbd2o5H4sajDWRzulHaD&amp;expires_in=6820"">charged that Republicans</a> crossed the line into illegal activity in an effort that was unsuccessful. Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, will appear on the ballot in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Republicans only managed to keep him off the ballot in Michigan, which they (incorrectly) viewed as a potential swing state, and Oklahoma, which is so red it glows crimson.
<p>Johnson is, like most third-party candidates in the past, just a blip in the polls. But even though he sees himself as a problem for both parties, with the potential of drawing votes from both Romney and Obama, it's the Republicans he was one of until he lost the fight for the nomination who are worried about his impact in Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Nevada.</p>
<p>Republicans are also concerned that Constitution Party presidential candidate Virgil Goode, a former Congressman from Virginia who is on the ballot in half the states, could shave off Romney votes on the Right. In the battleground state of Virginia that could make a difference.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the third-party spoiler effect comes from the Left, as it did from the Greens in 2000. The Greens and their candidate, Ralph Nader, received far more votes than the official margin of 537 between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000. The Supreme Court gave the presidency to Bush, but Democrats argue that there would have been no involvement of the court had Nader not siphoned off votes they believe Democrats would have received most of. Democrats got Nader off the Pennsylvania ballot in 2004, when he ran as an independent.</p>
<p>But for Romney, the threat, if there really is one, comes from the Right. In the case of the Libertarians, that's complicated because Johnson is further Right on economic issues than Romney but liberal on social issues such as marriage equality and legalizing marijuana for recreational use. He is also far to left of the GOP candidate on matters of national defense, having supported a cut on Pentagon spending of nearly half its budget:<br /></p>
<blockquote>The Republican efforts to impede Mr. Johnson?s candidacy have drawn charges of spying and coercion from Libertarians and countercharges from Republicans that the party had resorted to fraud while accepting secret help from Democrats.
<p>Democrats and Obama campaign officials deny any such involvement. But Mr. Johnson has been receiving critical help from Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative once so committed to his party that he has a tattoo of President Richard M. Nixon on his back. [...]</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson credited Mr. Stone?who helped organize for Mr. Bush the so-called Brooks Brothers riot that temporarily shut down the presidential election recount in Miami-Dade in 2000?with helping him navigate his way through the challenges, and with overall advice.</p>
</blockquote>
The Pennsylvania ballot-blocking effort was the GOP's final effort in such attempts across the nation this year. In 2004, the Libertarian candidate, Michael Badnarik, won 0.4 percent of the vote in the state. In 2008, Libertarian Bob Barr won 0.3 percent. &nbsp;Even if Johnson were to triple that, it would be a teensy slice of the millions of Pennsylvanians who will be casting ballots. The only way that becomes more than a blip, in Pennsylvania and in that handful of other potential swing states, is if the vote between Obama and Romney is extremely close. Despite Johnson's own claim that he will take votes from both candidates, the majority who will vote for him are Republicans. Despite all their efforts, there is nothing that Team Romney can do about that.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Paul Ryan washed dishes at a soup kitchen on Saturday ? even though the dishes were already clean.</div>
</div>
You know that <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/15/1144696/-Marathon-Man-Paul-Ryan-washes-clean-dishes-in-soup-kitchen-photo-op"">fake photo-op from Saturday</a> in which Paul Ryan washed dishes at a soup kitchen even though those dishes were already clean? Well, the head of the charity responds?and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/15/charity-president-unhappy-about-paul-ryan-soup-kitchen-photo-op/"">he's not happy</a> with Mr. Ryan:<br />
<blockquote>Brian J. Antag, president of the Mahoning County St. Vincent De Paul Society, said that he was not contacted by the Romney campaign ahead of the Saturday morning visit by Ryan, who stopped by the soup kitchen after a town hall at Youngstown State University.
<p>?We?re a faith-based organization; we are apolitical because the majority of our funding is from private donations,? Antag said in a phone interview Monday afternoon. ?It?s strictly in our bylaws not to do it. They showed up there and they did not have permission. They got one of the volunteers to open up the doors.?</p>
<p>He added: ?The photo-op they did wasn?t even accurate. He did nothing. He just came in here to get his picture taken at the dining hall.?</p>
</blockquote>
Actually, it was worse than nothing. Because in the process of trying to score political points by washing dishes that didn't need to be washed, Ryan injected politics into the charity, which is supposed to stay away from politics:<br />
<blockquote>Antag, a self-described independent voter, said that he ?can?t fault my volunteers? for letting the campaign in but said that the campaign ? didn?t go through the proper channels.?
<p>He noted that the soup kitchen relies on funding from private individuals who might reconsider their support if it appears that the charity is favoring one political candidate over another.</p>
<p>?I can?t afford to lose funding from these private individuals,? he said. ?For us to even appear like we?re backing somebody, it?s suicide. ? If this was the Democrats, I?d have the same exact problem. It doesn?t matter who it was.?</p>
</blockquote>
According to The Washington Post's Felicia Sonmez, who has done a great job covering this story, Antag said the whole incident has caused him a lot of ""grief."" As for what he would have done had Ryan asked for permission?<br />
<blockquote>""I certainly wouldn?t have let him wash clean pans and then take a picture,"" Antag said.</blockquote>
For the life me, I can't think of a better illustration of the fundamental emptiness that is the Romney campaign than this incident.

<blockquote>Vice President Joe Biden will appear on all three network morning shows on Wednesday, less than 10 hours after President Barack Obama faces off against Mitt Romney in the second presidential debate.
<p>Biden will appear on CBS This Morning, The Today Show, and Good Morning America, according to a network source.</p>
</blockquote>
This seems like a clear sign that the Obama campaign is taking tomorrow's debate much more seriously than the first, when they didn't have any big name surrogates scheduled to speak on the president's behalf the morning after the debate. Given that Joe Biden is the guy who singlehandedly put malarkey back in the American vocabulary, it seems equally clear that they want Mitt Romney's credibility to be a key part of the post-debate storyline. And with a strong debate performance from President Obama, that's a storyline they should be able to get.

"1093","http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/CddeaJOHnB0/-Pre-debate-post-debate-a-look-at-the-polls","","Pre-debate, post-debate: A look at the polls","1","-3","0","","2012-10-15 18:11:42","<p>As President Barack Obama took a dive in the polls after his disastrous first debate, my operating theory was that the bounce would fade after this weekend as the race's underlying dynamics reasserted themselves. That is, the fact that Obama was liked well enough, while Mitt Romney wasn't, would ultimately prevail and rebalance out the polls.</p>
<p>So how did that theory pan out?</p>
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
<p>Certainly mixed results. Just an FYI, the IBD/TIPP poll is <a href=""http://www.pollster.com/blogs/hitting_a_bullet_with_a_bullet.php?nr=1"">awful</a>, so I wouldn't celebrate it too much. Zogby may be even worse, so much so that they've rebranded as ""JZ Analytics."" RAND is an interesting experiment?they track the same group of people every day, so not a traditional poll. I used Gallup's registered voter numbers because they hadn't used their likely voter screen before the debate, so I wanted an apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<p>Caveats aside, we have everything from a three-point Obama gain to a six-point Romney gain, but with Obama mostly in the lead.</p>
<p>Now let's average all of the national polling, and we get this:</p>
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
<p>On Oct. 1, Obama had a three-point lead, 48.9-45.9. At the height of his post-debate bump, Romney had a 47.6-46.2 advantage (a 1.4-point Obama deficit), a shift of 4.4 points.</p>
<p>This morning, Obama is back to a 1.3-point lead, 48.5-47.2.</p>
<p>But what's more, most of the States That Matter never looked as bleak as the national polling did. PPP's national numbers will be the most pessimistic for Obama this week, by far. Yet their Ohio poll, conducted over pretty much the same time frame, gave Obama a 51-46 lead?compared to a 49-45 lead before the debate. NBC/Marist gave Obama a 51-45 Ohio lead, while CNN a 51-47 lead. Including all the crap GOP baby Rasmussens, Obama still leads the state <a href=""http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-ohio-president-romney-vs-obama#!"">48.4-45.5</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ohio is symptomatic of the Midwest, where Romney has been unable to claw his way back into serious contention in Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. Without those four states, Romney has to run the board on every other remaining battleground to win?Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia. Narrow Romney leads in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia won't be enough.</p>
<p>One thing has certainly changed from two weeks ago?no one will talk about expanding the electoral map anymore. Even if Arizona looks competitive, as one poll has suggested, expect the Obama campaign to hunker down and focus on getting to 270.</p>
<p>And of course, tomorrow looms large. We've seen that this year, debates can move serious numbers. Obama has to be on top of his game.</p>
<p>Because as the polling trend has borne out, one bad debate didn't dramatically change the underlying trends of this race. A second one, on the other hand, might be another story entirely.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Hiding behind Ann is kind of Mitt&#x27;s thing.</div>
</div>
Remember <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/20/1134418/-Not-breaking-Mitt-Romney-flip-flops-yet-again-This-time-about-a-TV-show?detail=hide"">that time</a> Mitt Romney got taunted into going on <em>The View</em>?
<p>First, we learned that among the many failtastic things Romney said in his no-longer-secret meeting with his rich donors?you know, that infamous 47 percent of America can go fuck itself meeting?he said going on <em>The View</em> was ""high risk"" because of the four ""sharp-tongued"" women who host it.</p>
<p>That was sort of embarrassing for him, especially when Sherri Shepherd, arguably the dumbest host of the show, taunted him:<br /></p>
<blockquote>""This is just pre-season,"" Shepherd said. ""If you can't handle four sharp-tongued women, how are you going to handle the country?""</blockquote>
That's a good question from the ""sharp-tongued"" woman who thinks there's a good chance the Earth is flat. No wonder Romney was afraid to face that kind of hard-hitting situation. So naturally, the campaign flip-flopped:<br />
<blockquote>The governor has been to ""The View"" and had a wonderful visit, and his team confirms this morning that the Romneys would love to once more join the sharp-tongued chatter in October.</blockquote>
See? Romney can <em>totally</em> be president because he's not afraid to face <em>The View</em>. Except ... not so fast. Looks like it's <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/mitt-romney-view-appearan_n_1967123.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003"">flip-flop o'clock again</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Barbara Walters announced on Monday's ""View"" that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney canceled on the ABC daytime talk show. His wife Ann will still appear on Thursday's show.</blockquote>
Considering that Romney's campaign only announced he would, in fact, be willing to face the sharp-tongued women after getting called out for being too afraid of them, it's extra sad that all of a sudden, oops, schedule conflict. But hey, the ever-chivalrous Mitt will be sending his catastrophically bad-at-talking-to-people wife Ann in his place. She's so much better at talking to Lady-Americans anyway. Not that we should be surprised. After all, as the Romney campaign <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/24/1113346/-Mitt-plans-to-hide-behind-Ann-s-skirts-cause-Obama-s-so-mean?detail=hide"">told us in July</a>, it's an official campaign strategy to have Mitt hide behind Ann's skirts whenever critics get too mean. Guess the sharp-tongued women of <em>The View</em> are no exception.

When, in his first debate with President Obama, Mitt Romney claimed to know nothing about tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas, did he spare a thought for workers at Sensata Technologies, a company controlled by Bain Capital with significant investments from Romney himself, who are about to become unemployed as their jobs are moved to China?
<p>Romney <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139911/-Transcript-of-presidential-debate-October-3-2012-President-Barack-Obama-and-Gov-Mitt-Romney?detail=hide"">said</a> to Obama that ""you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant."" <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1140134/-Fact-Check-Tax-Breaks-for-Shipping-Jobs-Overseas?detail=hide"">Obama was right; Romney was wrong.</a> Romney wasn't just wrong, though. He was heartless, dismissing the possibility of tax breaks for offshoring plants as a matter for his accountant, not a matter of people's lives and livelihoods. And at the very moment he was saying this, Sensata workers in Illinois were fighting to keep their jobs from going to Chinese replacement workers they had been forced to train themselves. Though Sensata is very profitable, Bain saw a chance for more profits in China, and saw 170 American jobs as disposable in pursuit of that profit.</p>
<p>The Sensata workers have been fighting for months, fighting to save their jobs or even to get people to pay attention to what's happening to them. They're not just losing jobs they've held for decades, in some cases. Workers close to retirement won't get their retirement. Instead, they'll get severance. But <a href=""http://rockrivertimes.com/2012/10/01/sensata-workers-attack-romney%E2%80%99s-profit-%E2%80%98harvest%E2%80%99-comments-begin-efforts-to-regain-severance/"">severance packages were cut</a> shortly before the layoffs were announced, so that, for instance, one worker who would have gotten more than a year of severance pay will now only get 26 weeks. This is a fight for what they've earned through years of hard work. It's a fight for their ability to pay the mortgage or send their kids to college, for their lives as they have lived them for decades working in this plant.</p>
<p>They've fought to get a moment of <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/18/1111260/-Workers-ask-Mitt-Romney-to-keep-Bain-from-sending-their-jobs-to-China?detail=hide"">Mitt Romney's attention</a>, anything beyond a canned statement that he has nothing to do with the offshoring he'll profit from.</p>
<p>When they tried to deliver a letter to Romney at a Romney campaign office, campaign staffers <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/16/1120836/-Daily-Kos-Labor-digest-Romney-campaign-calls-police-on-workers-whose-jobs-are-being-sent-to-China?detail=hide"">called the police on them</a>.</p>
<p>They've <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/22/1123057/-Mitt-Romney-and-Bain-still-denying-responsibility-for-outsourcing-at-Romney-and-Bain-owned-company?detail=hide"">delivered 35,000 petition signatures</a> to Bain Capital asking for their jobs to be saved.</p>
<p>They've <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/18/1133504/-Chinese-outsourcing-spells-profit-to-Mitt-Romney-For-these-Illinois-workers-it-means-unemployment?detail=hide"">camped out outside the factory</a>, and three of their supporters, including the teenage daughter of a Sensata worker, have been <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/09/1141566/-Daily-Kos-Labor-digest-Offshoring-protest-at-Bain-owned-Sensata-leads-to-arrests?detail=hide"">arrested</a> trying to block equipment from being moved out of the plant.</p>
<p>And for Mitt Romney, this is a glib line about needing a better accountant. It's about squeezing a little more out of the tens of millions of dollars he gets from Bain every year.</p>
<p>Not that voters would know anything about it if he did, since he's so determined to hide his tax returns from us peons. We do know that Romney has already gotten <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/mitt-romney-sensata-tax-break_n_1920396.html"">personal tax savings</a> for donating Sensata stock to charitable foundations. Beyond that? He won't let us know what he's been up to. It is true that the amount of the tax break Sensata stands to get for moving operations overseas is small compared to the amount it will save by cutting well-paid jobs in America and replacing them with jobs paying 99 cents an hour, 12 hours a day in China. But I guarantee you Romney's accountant knows all about it?and that Romney does, too.</p>
<p>Even in the middle of a tight race for president, Mitt Romney doesn't care to help these workers. Maybe if they were from Ohio, not Illinois, things would be different. But they're just workers making him profit, not valuable swing-state voters, so to Romney, these Americans are disposable.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">""My tax plan math is good. And don't just take my word for it. Ask Dick Cheney!""</div>
</div>
Here's how Mitt Romney defended his tax plan math in a television ad <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTKOtgibTqw&amp;feature=plcp"">released</a> by his campaign two weeks ago:<br />
<blockquote>According to a non-partisan, <strong>independent</strong> study, Barack Obama and the liberals will raise taxes on the middle class by $4,000. The same organization says the plan from Mitt Romney and commonsense conservatives is ""not a tax-hike on the middle class."" Want proof? Read the non-partisan study for yourself.</blockquote>
It was immediately obvious the ad's claim about the study's independence <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/04/1139966/-Romney-celebrates-debate-performance-by-citing-non-partisan-analysis-from-Cheney-backed-think-tank"">was bogus</a>: the organization that released the ""study"" is the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank that's so tightly aligned with Republicans that Dick Cheney sits on its board.
<p>And yesterday on Fox News, top Romney aide Ed Gillespie effectively conceded the point, <a href=""http://youtu.be/dkQK4_FJ1Jw"">admitting</a> that AEI is in fact a ""right-leaning think-tank.""<br /></p>
<blockquote>GILLESPIE: AEI and other sources are very credible sources for economic analysis.
<p>CHRIS WALLACE: You wouldn't say that AEI is a conservative think-tank?</p>
<p>GILLESPIE: I would say that it is a right-leaning think-tank. That doesn't make it not credible.</p>
</blockquote>
Okay, fine. In theory you can be credible and be right-leaning. And if the Romney campaign had called AEI a ""right-leaning think-tank"" instead of a ""non-partisan, independent"" think-tank, we could have a conversation. But when you describe a group as ""independent"" from one side of your mouth and ""right-leaning"" from the other side, the credibility problem is all of your own making.
<p>Gillespie tried to defend the campaign's claim by saying that AEI is ""not a partisan organization,"" but that's only accurate in the sense that it's not literally a part of the Republican Party. Well, sure, except for the part about it's run and funded by Republicans.</p>
<p>It's obvious what the Romney campaign was trying to say when they described AEI as <em>both</em> ""non-partisan"" <em>and</em> ""independent"": they were trying to convince voters to believe Romney's tax plan math ads up because an independent, trustworthy, unbiased third party group said it did.</p>
<p>And the bottom-line is that as even Ed Gillespie conceded, AEI isn't what the Romney campaign made it out to be. And if the Romney campaign can't even be honest in what it claims other people are claiming about Romney's tax plan, why should anyone believe what <em>he</em> claims about it?</p>

Republican Ohio Senator Rob Portman, <a href=""http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/rob-portman-falsely-claims-unemployment-is-higher-than"">responding to a question</a> from ABC's Jake Tapper about why Paul Ryan falsely claimed during last week's vice presidential debate that the unemployment rate had increased throughout America since President Obama took office:<br />
<blockquote>I think that what he was saying is the truth, which is, unemployment's higher today than when the president took office. And you know, unfortunately, in the meantime, we?ve created net zero jobs, Jake.</blockquote>
That's just <a href=""http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000"">wrong</a>. The unemployment rate today is 7.8 percent. That's the same as it was in George W. Bush's last month in office and it's less than the 8.3 percent rate recorded during President Obama's first full month. Portman's other claim was also false: <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/27/1137108/-Obama-is-now-a-net-job-creator"">more people</a> are working today than when President Obama took office. That might be bad news for Portman's political aspirations, but it doesn't give him the right to deny it.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">The only thing better than a twice-baked bean is a twice-washed pan. (<a href=""http://www.wkbn.com/content/news/local/story/VP-Candidate-Stops-and-Helps-at-Soup-Kitchen/SVYlU4t9vU6KWOIFYXXQ2g.cspx"">WKBN</a>)</div>
</div>
So <a href=""http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2012/10/did-ryan-campaign-fake-photo-op-at-ohio-soup-kitchen-and-did-media-enable-it/"">this</a> is pretty crazy: on Saturday, Paul Ryan planned to have a photo op washing dishes and serving food at a Youngstown, Ohio soup kitchen ... but by the time he arrived, the food had already been served and the dishes had apparently already been done. So he did what any politician in need of a photo op would do?he <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/13/reporters-barred-from-covering-paul-ryan-exchange-with-homeless-ohioans-outside-soup-kitchen/"">washed them again</a>, for the benefit of the cameras:<br />
<blockquote>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio ? Paul Ryan visited a soup kitchen here Saturday on his way to the airport, but by the time the GOP vice presidential nominee and his family had arrived shortly before noon, the grits, sausage and doughnuts had been served, the hall was empty of patrons and the volunteers appeared to have already cleaned up. [...]
<p>Ryan stood at the sink and took some large metal pans that did not appear to be dirty, soaped them up and rinsed them, remarking as the cameras clicked and the TV cameras rolled that he had spent a summer washing dishes when he was younger.<br />
?We had a Hobart, though, which was ? you get calluses on your fingers because it?s so hot,? he said, referring to the Hobart industrial dishwashing machine.</p>
</blockquote>
That was <em>The Washington Post's</em> report. Here's what <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/us/politics/gop-ticket-focuses-on-crucial-ohio-votes.html?_r=2&amp;ref=politics"">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Afterward, Mr. Ryan stopped with his wife and children at a nearby soup kitchen. The family put on aprons and washed several large pans, though they did not appear to need washing, according to a pool reporter. There also was no one to serve at the soup kitchen, as breakfast had ended.</blockquote>
In Paul Ryan's defense, he's running for office for Pete's sake. And nothing will stop him from trying to convince voters that Mitt Romney and he have the empathy Americans expect in a president and vice president?even if that means wasting everybody's time by washing dishes that don't need to be washed.

<b>Race Ratings</b>:
<p>This week, we're making a dozen changes to our race ratings, two on our <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/11/1082263/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Senate-race-ratings-2012?detail=hide"">Senate chart</a> and 10 on our <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/12/1091020/-Daily-Kos-Elections-House-race-ratings-2012?detail=hide"">House big board</a>. The moves are split equally between those benefitting Democrats and Republicans:</p>
<p>? <b>HI-Sen</b> (Lean D to Likely D): It looks like we're finally back to where we conceived of this race at the outset. Former Gov. Linda Lingle might have been the strongest possible recruit the GOP could ever hope for in Hawaii, but she can't change the state's Democratic demographics?nor the fact that favorite son Barack Obama is on the ballot once again. Recent polling has shown Dem Rep. Mazie Hirono with solid leads, and Lingle's only response has been to carp about the numbers, not provide any contradictory data of her own. The headwinds are simply too great for her.</p>
<p>? <b>NM-Sen</b> (Lean D to Likely D): Aside from a single ""I'm not dead yet!"" internal from ex-Rep. Heather Wilson herself, a long series of polls has shown Dem Rep. Martin Heinrich with leads that are both sizable and growing. The NRSC gave up here a long time ago and hasn't shown any sign of coming back; same with the DSCC.</p>
<p>? <b>CT-04</b> (Likely D to Safe D): We wanted to hedge our bets on this Connecticut seat that's really a creature of the NYC suburbs. Home to lots of Wall Street types and reliably Republican on the congressional level for many years, we figured there was a chance that Steve Obsitnik could gain some traction. But Rep. Jim Himes has proved to be a good fit for this district, and, in an extreme rarity, he was one of only about half a dozen Democrats to improve on his 2008 performance in 2010. TV time here is wildly expensive, and it's just hard to imagine the national GOP wanting to get involved here when the bang-for-the-buck is so much greater elsewhere.</p>
<p>? <b>IL-08</b> (Likely D to Lean D): The fact that freshman GOP Rep. Joe Walsh isn't automatic driftwood is a sign of just how distant a hope a Democratic House majority is. Tammy Duckworth has raised exceptional sums, and she's still favored. But the polling hasn't shown a slam dunk for her, and a fortune has been spent against her by conservative third-party groups who just refuse to give up on Walsh. But Barack Obama's just not doing as well in his home state as he did four years ago, and Gov. Pat Quinn is in the running for the most unpopular governor in the nation. All this is creating a drag on Illinois Democrats, and even Duckworth's not immune.</p>
<p>? <b>MN-01</b> (Likely D to Safe D): The DCCC recently cut back its ad reservations that were originally intended to shore up Rep. Tim Walz. There's also been no indication that outside groups are interested in helping Republican Allen Quist, who emerged wounded after a long and ugly primary battle that included a nasty deadlocked convention.</p>
<p>? <b>NJ-03</b> (Lean R to Likely R): Democrats landed a good recruit in the form of Shelley Adler, whose late husband, John Adler, held this seat for one term before losing in 2010's wave. But despite a couple of strong fundraising quarters, this remains tough turf: John Adler, who raised a ton of money, only won by four percent in 2008 when this was an open seat. On top of that, the 3rd became a couple of points redder in redistricting, to the benefit of GOP Rep. Jon Runyan. In recent weeks, the DCCC has cancelled all (or almost all) of the airtime it had reserved in the costly Philadelphia market that was earmarked for this seat, and the NRCC was only all too happy to follow suit. Without that outside help, this seat feels like an incredibly tough nut to crack.</p>
<p>? <b>NY-17</b> (Likely D to Safe D): When Joe Carvin dropped down from the Senate race to take on veteran Rep. Nita Lowey instead, he seemed like a good recruit for Republicans: He's both an elected official (Rye Town supervisor) and personally wealthy (thanks to his day job as a hedge fund manager). Redistricting also made this seat about seven points redder, according to presidential results. But much like Jim Himes in the adjacent CT-04 (see above), Lowey's insulated by the pricey NYC media market, which always gives pause to national organizations. Carvin's donated a million bucks to his own cause, but it doesn't look like he'll get much assistance from anyone else.</p>
<p>? <b>NY-22, NY-23</b> (Lean R to Safe R): This pair of swingy, upstate New York districts looked like potential targets for Democrats when redistricting left Reps. Richard Hanna and Tom Reed with seats that were almost half new to them. But Dem recruits Dan Lamb and Nate Shinagawa raised very little money; Reed, meanwhile, has a ton, while Hanna may be the most moderate Republican in the House (in word and deed). It just won't be possible to dislodge them this time.</p>
<p>? <b>PA-08</b> (Lean R to Likely R): The story is very similar on the other side of the Delaware River from the adjacent NJ-03 (see above), where Democrat Kathy Boockvar simply hasn't gained the traction she's needed against GOP Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick. Both the D-Trip and NRCC have cut back on their Philly ad reservations here as well, and no one seems to be acting as though this is a positive sign for Team Blue.</p>
<p>? <b>UT-04</b> (Tossup to Lean R): Dem Rep. Jim Matheson has survived the unsurvivable for years, but it's hard not to feel like his luck may have just run out. Utah Republicans targeted him?and hard?in redistricting, giving Matheson no good options in terms of seeking re-election. He opted for Utah's bluest seat, which at 56-41 McCain actually makes it the reddest seat that any Democratic incumbent is running in this cycle. On top of that, most of that turf (almost 70%) is new to Matheson. Recent polling, including an independent survey and an internal for his opponent, Mia Love, has shown the Republican leading, and the DCCC hasn't spent any money on him. That doesn't mean Matheson's been triaged (other groups like House Majority PAC and, more recently, Patriot Majority USA have tried to fill the breach), but if he's been living on borrowed time, it sure feels like his time's up.</p>
<p>? <b>WA-06</b> (Likely D to Safe D): When veteran Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks announced his retirement, there were a ton of potential candidates ready to fill his shoes. But state Sen. Derek Kilmer announced quickly and completely cleared the field, a sign of his strength as a candidate. Republican Bill Driscoll has self-funded half-a-mil, but a recent SurveyUSA poll gave Kilmer a commanding 52-37 lead. This is blue turf, and Driscoll would somehow have to run far ahead of Mitt Romney to have a chance here. We can't see how that would happen.</p>

<blockquote>Biden succeeded, as evidenced by the fact that the lion?s share of post-debate commentary was All About Joe. Critics said he smiled too much, interrupted his opponent too often, came across as too ?hot? for a medium that is all about cool. But these complaints only reinforced the fact that Biden was the protagonist of the evening. [...]

<p>Oh, about the voucher thing: In his debate with Vice President Biden, Mr. Ryan was actually the first one to mention vouchers, attempting to rule the term out of bounds. Indeed, it?s apparently the party line on the right that anyone using the word ?voucher? to describe a health policy in which you?re given a fixed sum to apply to health insurance is a liar, not to mention a big meanie.</p>
<p>Among the lying liars, then, is the guy who, in 2009, described the Ryan plan as a matter of ?converting Medicare into a defined contribution sort of voucher system.? Oh, wait ? that was Paul Ryan himself.</p>

<blockquote>At a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last Wednesday, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California and the committee?s chairman, talked of ?examining security failures that led to the Benghazi tragedy.? He said lawmakers had an obligation to protect federal workers overseas. On Sunday, he said more should be spent on diplomatic security.
<p>But as part of the Republican majority that has controlled the House the last two years, Mr. Issa joined in cutting nearly a half-billion dollars from the State Department?s two main security accounts. One covers things like security staffing, including local guards, armored vehicles and security technology; the other, embassy construction and upgrades. In 2011 and 2012, President Obama sought a total of $5 billion, and the House approved $4.5 billion. In 2009, Mr. Issa voted for an amendment that would have cut nearly 300 diplomatic security positions. And the draconian budgets proposed by Mitt Romney?s running mate, Representative Paul Ryan, would cut foreign affairs spending by 10 percent in 2013 and even more in 2016.</p>

<blockquote>In a speech this week, CBS News foreign correspondent Lara Logan ripped the Obama administration for its feckless response to the Libya attack, declaring it was time for the U.S. to ?exact revenge and let the world know that the United States will not be attacked on its own soil. That its ambassadors will not be murdered, and that the United States will not stand by and do nothing about it.?
<p>She is absolutely right. Perhaps President Obama has some decisive action planned. Perhaps when the White House is done trying to cover up this terrorist attack, it will pivot to responding to this terrorist attack. That would be a welcome ?October surprise? indeed.</p>
<p>But as of now, all the world sees is a president who is afraid to call an act of terror what it is, much less do something about it.</p>

<p>The former Republican vice president adores the Republican vice presidential candidate because Ryan is a fresh, young Cheney.</p>
<p>Cheney moved to Washington as soon as he could and became a political careerist, working as a Capitol Hill aide, a think-tank hanger on and then a member of Congress. Ryan followed the same insider trajectory.</p>
<p>Cheney?s a hyper-partisan Republican with a history of putting party loyalty above everything else. Ryan?s an equally loyal GOP mandarin.</p>
<p>Cheney?s a rigid ideologue who has never let reality get in the way of cockamamie neocon theories about where to start the next war. And Ryan?s every bit as much a neocon as Cheney.</p>

Ryan debate?the intersection of a politician's faith and his or her commitment to secular government:
<blockquote>But beyond the horseshit something genuinely disturbing and scary got said last night by Paul Ryan that is, I think, easily missed and still worth brooding over. [...]
<p>Paul Ryan did not say, as John Kennedy had said before him, that faith was faith and public service, public service, each to be honored and kept separate from the other. No, he said instead ?I don?t see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do.? That?s a shocking answer?a mullah?s answer, what those scary Iranian ?Ayatollahs? he kept referring to when talking about Iran would say as well. Ryan was rejecting secularism itself, casually insisting, as the Roman Catholic Andrew Sullivan put it, that ?the usual necessary distinction between politics and religion, between state and church, cannot and should not exist.? And he went on to make it quietly plain that his principles are uncompromising on this, even if his boss?s policy may not seem so.</p>

<blockquote>There are a lot of things to admire about Mitt Romney. His extraordinary number of both homes and khaki-clad offspring (and offspring's offspring). His impressive attempts to emulate the emotions of real human beings. And his campaign's increasingly creative relationship with the truth.

<blockquote>It should be noted that Ryan had a terrific night. He was prepared, he was fluent in every policy matter and made no mistakes?crossing the credibility threshold for vice president and, potentially one day, for president. But he didn?t leave Biden bleeding, and therefore Biden has likely stopped the bleeding, at least until Tuesday when Obama faces Romney again at their second debate. [...]
<p>It was too much to ask Biden to clean up President Obama?s debate mess from last week?but he brought the fight Democrats pine for, the passion victory requires, and he provided reassurance to the party that this campaign is not, in fact, already over. But there?s not much left Biden?or Bill Clinton?can do for Obama and if he doesn?t become as convincing as they are, then it will be over.</p>

<blockquote>The reviews are in and, with the exception of a few right-wing commentators, everyone thinks Martha Raddatz did a great job moderating the vice-presidential debate Thursday. At the very least, she was better than Jim Lehrer, who ineffectually sat on stage during the first debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. But both debates have skipped over serious, important issues, and have given too little attention, or the wrong kind of attention, to others. Conor Friedersdorf noted the total absence of discussion about civil-liberties issues at the first debate, a pattern that continued Thursday night. But there are plenty more missing.</blockquote>

<a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/10/romney-ryan-medicaid"">Kevin Drum</a> says Mitt Romney's plans for Medicaid would destroy it by turning it into a block-grant program:
<blockquote>This means the program would be turned over entirely to the states. The federal government would continue to provide a share of funding, but that funding would go straight into state coffers, and states could decide how to spend it. So the question is: Once released from federal regulations, what would states do with their Medicaid money?
<p>Romney's plan represents a massive change in our commitment to providing decent medical care for those who can least afford it.<br />
Some states would probably try some genuinely interesting experiments, though it's unlikely we'll ever discover any magic bullets for reining in health care costs on a state level. But lots of states, especially poor states in the South, don't have much interest in experimenting. They just want to slash eligibility for Medicaid. Given the freedom to do it, they'd adopt what Ed Kilgore calls the ""Mississippi model,"" cutting off coverage for a family of three earning anything over $8,200. For all the talk of fresh thinking and new solutions, what they really want to do is simple: They want to stop providing medical care for poor people.</p>

<a href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/15/3047566_p2/what-the-cuban-missile-crisis.html#storylink=cpy"">Fred Kaplan</a> tries to untangle some myths?he rightly labels them lies?about the Cuban missile crisis that we're hearing a lot about this month on its 50th anniversary:
<blockquote>One of these myths has been thoroughly exploded (though many eminences seem not to know it). This is the notion that President John F. Kennedy got Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to back down and remove his nuclear missiles from Cuba entirely through the threat of force. In fact, as revealed by JFK?s secret tape recordings of his meetings with senior advisers (evidence that?s been available at the Kennedy Library for 25 years now), the two leaders brokered a deal: Khrushchev would take his missiles out of Cuba; Kennedy would take his very similar missiles out of Turkey. [...]
<p>For years, Khrushchev had boasted that his factories were cranking out ICBMs ?like sausages.? In fact, though, he had nothing; the missile program was in total disarray. And now the Americans were calling his bluff. [...]</p>
<p>The resolution of the Cuban crisis may hold some lessons for crises today.</p>
<p>First, antagonists should stay in touch with each other. There was no telephone contact between Kennedy and Khrushchev in October 1962. But they did send telegrams back and forth, and Kennedy maintained a back channel through the Soviet embassy?even as ships and submarines confronted one another, troops were mobilized, and, in one particularly tense moment, a U-2 spy plane was shot down. Without those communiqus, the crisis might easily have escalated into war.</p>

<td>During the first debate in Denver, Mitt Romney became very offended when the president suggested that?get this!?Mitt Romney might have missed out on a tax deduction he could have taken.
<p>??you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I?ve been in business for 25 years,? the GOP nominee for president and longtime CEO of Bain Capital said. ?I have no idea what you?re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.?</p>
<p>Unless the plural of accountant is ?accountant,? everything about this answer is BS.[...]</p>
<p>Romney used deception to excuse his life?s work of cheapening the value of American labor and avoiding taxes while casting the president as ignorant about business. In a visual medium where appearance is everything, Romney galloped half-truths and blatant falsehoods like this over and over in a confident yet cool manner. And though the media knew that he disregarded the facts, they said he?d won. And the polls agreed.</p>
<p>Now Romney must feel as if he can get away with anything. ?I?ve got these fools thinking I don?t talk to my ?accountant,?? he must be saying to himself. ?What <em>can?t</em> I say?? Nothing, apparently.</p>

<td>Bloggers use links to give readers the opportunity to view their source material. When a blogger makes an assertion, you can typically check the validity of that assertion by following links to that blogger's source, and decide for yourself whether it's been properly analyzed.
<p>When traditional media use links, they tend to point to that media outlet's collection of archived articles on the proper noun they've attached the link to.</p>
<p>So when a blogger says, ""President Bush today announced his intention to invade Liechtenstein,"" that blogger would tend to attach the link to something like ""announced his intention,"" and have it point to a newspaper article or White House press release containing a quote from Bush, saying, ""I intend to invade Liechtenstein.""</p>
<p>When a newspaper says, ""President Bush today announced his intention to invade Liechtenstein,"" the links are on ""President Bush,"" and ""Liechtenstein."" And they link to archived articles about President Bush and Liechtenstein, in every other context in which that paper has written about those subjects.<br />

<p>You may have seen the internet banners: return to school in your 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond.

Hell, our local NFL team, the Arizona Cardinals, plays at the University of Phoenix <em>Stadium</em>?no peewee sign in the end zone for them! UP's parent company, the <a href=""http://www.apollogrp.edu/"">Apollo Group</a>, shells out about $7.5 million a year for naming rights to the big aluminum muffin. The University of Phoenix itself has no sports teams, anywhere, but $7.5 million is walk-around change for Apollo, which, in addition to UP, owns more than a half-dozen other large for-profit colleges and universities. Based in Phoenix, the Apollo Group, a Fortune 500 company, made about <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-26/apollo-group-gains-the-most-in-eight-months-on-profit-forecast"">$740 million</a> last year.

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Working the ground game to register new voters</div>
</div>
Of all the netizen activists I know, there are very few whom I respect more than Marta Evry.
<p>You may have seen her diaries here under the byline of <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/user/msblucow"">msblucow</a>. Her blogging at <a href=""http://veniceforchange.blogspot.com/"">Venice For Change</a> has a significant influence on local politics in the Los Angeles area, and politicians and candidates either love her or fear her. If they're smart, they do both at the same time. Marta is a wizard behind the lens of a camera, and if I use one more of her photos for my Facebook profile, I have every confidence she'll start charging me for the privilege. I've seen her photos drive entire narratives for campaigns in a way only the most iconic visual imagery can do.</p>
<p>But what sets Marta apart from many others is the recognition of a simple fact: No matter what happens online, the essence of being a community organizer usually involves getting off of the blogs and into the streets. That's why every two years, she organizes a voter registration drive at a well-attended local streets festival in her neighborhood of Venice, California.</p>
<p>No matter how large a voice one may have online, there really isn't anything quite like the feeling of helping a new citizen register and see the excitement in his face about knowing that he'll be able to have a voice in American civic discourse. Few things can rival telling a felon that no matter what the law is in Arizona, out in the Golden State we let people who have paid their debt to society and are off parole have a voice in our democracy again, and seeing the tear in his eye because you told him what nobody else would. Even something as mundane as helping someone who won't be in town on election day get a ballot abroad is incredibly rewarding. Between Marta, me and the dozen other volunteers working the booth that day, we registered over four hundred people. That is four hundred people who may not have gotten the chance to cast a ballot otherwise: Four hundred different stories, ranging from people who had moved across the world to people who had moved across the street, and all eager for the opportunity to vote for the people they want to represent them from the highest office in the land to the lowest office on the ballot.</p>
<p>Now, some may say that it doesn't really matter in deep-blue California: After all, Barack Obama will win the state easily, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein will coast to reelection without lifting a finger. But there is so much more than just the top of the ticket: In the Venice area alone, for instance, longtime Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman is being challenged by a Republican-turned-independent who is spending millions to try to buy a seat in Congress. Just next door to the South is the swing Assembly District Democrats will need to win if we are to gain the super-majority we need to actually govern the state. And even in a state as large as California, we know that grassroots efforts to register and educate progressive voters could make the difference between whether <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/15/1108363/-California-s-special-exemptions-act-The-biggest-threat-you-haven-t-heard-of"">the odious Proposition 32</a> passes and takes away the voices of working men and women in the state, or whether Democrats and progressive of all stripes beat back this right-wing affront to democracy.</p>
<div class=""dkimg-l""><span class=""image_container""><img alt=""vote-by-mail promotional graphic"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/8036/small/LACDP-VBM.jpg?1350026296"" /></span>
<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Consider the convenience of voting by mail this November.</div>
</div>
Even more than that, we encouraged as many of our new registrants as possible to register as ""permanent vote-by-mail"" voters. Under California law, all of these new voters?many of whom will have been motivated by President Obama?will receive a ballot in the mail every single election, which dramatically increases their chances of voting in state and local elections and becoming better-informed about what is happening in their communities.
<p>Not every state has the same laws and deadlines as we do on the West Coast, and some deadlines have unfortunately already passed. But even if there is absolutely no contested issue you can think of at any level this upcoming November, consider spending whatever time your state laws still allow to get out on the ground and get new voters signed up to participate in the fundamental exercise of democracy. You might find it to be a reward in and of itself.</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">When Affirmative Action Was White:<br />
An Untold History of Racial Inequality in<br />
Twentieth-Century America. Ira Katznelson</div>
</div>
Which is why we still need affirmative action.
<p>Don't think we are now living in some type of post-racial wonderland simply because we now have a black president, and will for the next four years?voters willing. We know that economic inequity has deepened the divide between the rich and the rest of us, and we have blinders on if we fail to see the relationship between social class and race/ethnicity in our society. Key to the development of a middle class is education beyond high school, yet when we live in a country which still has de-facto segregation in much of K through 12 education, we cannot make the old segregationist argument that ""separate, is equal.""</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/06/schools-are-more-segregated-today-than-during-the-late-1960s/258348/"">Schools Are More Segregated Today Than During the Late 1960s</a> was the headline of an article in <em>The Atlantic</em> over the summer.</p>
<p>Ironically, <a href=""http://www.epi.org/blog/segregation-black-white-achievement-gap-romneys/"">Mitt Romney's father George</a> attempted to address this, pointing to housing discrimination as a root cause.</p>
<blockquote>Forty years ago, George Romney, Mitt?s father, resigned as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development after unsuccessfully attempting to force homogenous white middle-class suburbs to integrate by race. Secretary Romney withheld federal funds from suburbs that did not accept scatter-site public and subsidized low and moderate income housing and that did not repeal exclusionary zoning laws that prohibited multi-unit dwellings or modest single family homes?laws adopted with the barely disguised purpose of ensuring that suburbs would remain white and middle class.
<p>Confronted at a press conference about his cabinet secretary?s actions, President Nixon undercut Romney, responding, ?I believe that forced integration of the suburbs is not in the national interest.? This has since been unstated national policy and as a result, low-income African Americans remain concentrated in distressed urban neighborhoods and their children remain in what we mistakenly think are ?failing schools.? Nationwide, African Americans remain residentially as isolated from whites as they were in 1950, and more isolated than in 1940. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
Crickets from Romney on the <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/""><em>Fisher v. University of Texas</em></a> case.
<p>NBC's Martin Bashir talks about Mitt Romney gutting affirmative action in Massachusetts, as did <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/02/romneys-record-on-affirma_n_1564644.html"">an article</a> in the Huffington Post.</p>
<center>




</center>
<br />
The looming decision we are faced with from the Supreme Court as they sit to decide the fate of affirmative action in our nations colleges and universities is not simply a matter of higher education, nor is this discussion one that should be examined as solely the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. &nbsp;
<p>All of the seething resentment about ""entitlements"" and ""reverse discrimination"" (a <a href=""http://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1977/1977_76_811"">Bakke</a> era term I abhor) that you hear presented as a rationale to dump the programs, are rooted in history, one that we often fail to acknowledge. The playing field is not only not level, it was rigged, and still is. &nbsp;</p>

Oh, here we go. A whole maudlin little column from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on how the thing to be outraged about, in this election, <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443749204578048682120159150.html"">is all the mean people who are calling Mitt Romney a liar</a>. Feel the indignity!<br />
<blockquote>[O]ne wonders why the Obama people think this will have deep political resonance. The idea that they can make voters who live outside the political steam baths believe that a man running for the presidency would stand in front of 67 million people and literally ""lie"" about a proposal to change the federal tax code is ludicrous.</blockquote>
(Yes, everybody knows politicians running for high office would never lie about their policies. Such a thing has never happened, and could never happen, and how cynical are <em>you</em>, dear reader, for supposedly remembering all those times it has?)
<p>Thrill at the arbitrary reference to fascism!<br /></p>
<blockquote>The Obama campaign's resurrection of ""liar"" as a political tool is odious because it has such a repellent pedigree. It dates to the sleazy world of fascist and totalitarian propaganda in the 1930s.</blockquote>
(Calling a liar out for being a liar is also common and, we must point out, the morally correct response to actual lying, an approach followed by teachers, juries, nuns, our greatest philosophers and most of the rest of the civilized planet. When I catch my child in a lie, I would not be impressed by her declaring that me pointing it out is just like what Hitler would have done. However, my child is also intelligent enough to recognize a non-sequiter when she sees one, which has already permanently disqualified her from working for Fox News or writing a column for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.)

<blockquote>Mostly, though, think of the debate this way: In 2008, Joe Biden, who smiled at Sarah Palin the way one does at a particularly precocious toddler, had to hold his fire for fear of seeming sexist or bullying to the then-governor. He got to unload on Ryan. And all those years in the Senate, all those years confronting presidents, all of it came to bear last night as he beat down Ryan viciously and mercilessly. Ryan is the perfect product of Republican America, someone who grew up in the Reagan era in a protected bubble, who learned at the knee of conservatives and worked for people like Sam Brownback, a man whose philosophy is a synthesis of cruel social conservatism and bastardized Ayn Rand. In other words, he is everything Joe Biden has fought against. Of course Biden was gonna cut off this puffed up punk at the knees. That Ryan asshole brought up a fatal car crash in front of the guy who lost his wife and daughter in one. Shit, when it was done, you half-expected the Vice President to brush his shoulder.
<p>It is probably Biden's last time on the big stage. Give the bright-toothed guy his victory lap.</p>

<blockquote>Mr. Obama?s camp argues for an active government role; his last major economic proposal, the American Jobs Act, would have tried to accelerate recovery by sustaining public spending and putting money in the hands of people likely to use it. Republicans, on the other hand, insist that the path to prosperity involves sharp cuts in government spending.
<p>And Republicans are dead wrong.</p>
<p>The latest devastating demonstration of that wrongness comes from the International Monetary Fund, which has just released its World Economic Outlook, a report combining short-term prediction with insightful economic analysis. This report is a grim and disturbing document, telling us that the world economy is doing significantly worse than expected, with rising risks of global recession. But the report isn?t just downbeat; it contains a careful analysis of the reasons things are going so badly. And what this analysis concludes is that a disproportionate share of the bad news is coming from countries pursuing the kind of austerity policies Republicans want to impose on America.</p>

<blockquote>Many environmental groups and green-minded politicians in the Pacific Northwest are already on record as opposing a wave of export terminals proposed from here to the south-central coast of Oregon, aiming to ship coal to Asia. But in recent weeks, Indian tribes have been linking arms as well, citing possible injury to fishing rights and religious and sacred sites if the coal should spill or the dust from its trains and barges should waft too thick.
<p>And as history has demonstrated over and over, especially in this part of the nation, from protecting fish habitats to removing dams, a tribal-environmental alliance goes far beyond good public relations. The cultural claims and treaty rights that tribes can wield ? older and materially different, Indian law experts say, than any argument that the Sierra Club or its allies might muster about federal air quality rules or environmental review ? add a complicated plank of discussion that courts and regulators have found hard to ignore.</p>

<p>But a raft of evidence ? internal Bank of America memos and emails obtained by ProPublica, interviews with two bank staff members who have worked on the review, and little-noticed documents released late last year by a federal banking regulator ? throw the independence of the review into serious doubt. Together, they indicate that Bank of America ? the financial giant with the largest number of homeowners eligible for the program ? is performing much of the work itself.</p>
<p>The ultimate decision as to whether and how much a homeowner will be compensated is not made by Bank of America, the evidence shows, but is based largely on work that the bank itself performs.

<blockquote>Arlen Specter, the irascible senator from Pennsylvania who was at the center of many of the Senate?s most divisive legal battles ? from the Supreme Court nominations of Robert H. Bork and Clarence Thomas to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton ? only to lose his seat in 2010 after quitting the Republican Party to become a Democrat, died Sunday morning at his home in Pennsylvania.

<p>Hard-bitten and tenacious yet ever the centrist, Mr. Specter was a part of American public life for more than four decades.

<p>He relished his work on the Judiciary Committee. In 1987, he enraged conservatives by derailing Judge Bork?s nomination to the Supreme Court and then delighted them four years later by backing Justice Thomas.

<p>In the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan said that ""Mitt Romney is a car guy."" If Ryan meant a used car guy, I would agree. Romney is a used car salesman who will lie about anything to ""make the sale."" Bill Clinton captured Romney's used car salesman schtick well:</p>

<br />
<blockquote>I had a different reaction to that first debate &nbsp;than a lot of people did. I mean, I thought, ?Wow! Here?s old Moderate Mitt. &nbsp;Where you been, boy, I missed you all these last two years!? But I was paying &nbsp;attention these past two years. And it was like one of these Bain Capital deals &nbsp;where, you know, he?s the closer. So he shows up, doesn?t really know much about &nbsp;the deal and says, <b>?tell me what I?m supposed to say to close.?</b> [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
To close and get the coffee, Romney has to lie. And if there is one thing Romney is good at, it is lying. He may not have <a href=""http://youtu.be/yfUZND486Ik"">invented lying</a>, but he may have perfected it. I always thought Ari Fleischer was the best liar in public life because he had no conscience whatsoever about telling bald-faced lies. (By contrast, Scott McClellan's downfall came as a result of having a conscience about telling bald-faced lies.) That's why Fleischer is truly the best Romney surrogate out there. If ever a spokesperson and a political candidate were made for each other, it is Romney and Fleischer. They both lie with impunity and without conscience. About EVERYTHING!
<p>So how do you deal with that type of political opponent? One who goes beyond the bounds of spin, pulling facts out of context, and the normal truth stretching one sees in politics? How do you deal with bald-faced lying in an era where the media simply is too inept or too corrupt to do its job? Vice President Joe Biden demonstrated an effective way to do it in a certain debate setting. But Biden's circumstances are different from those of President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>First, Biden is the vice president on the ticket?he does not have to worry about his favorables (VP candidates have played the attack dog role for a reason). Second, Biden's debate opponent, Ryan, was simply not as good a liar as Romney is. Remember, Romney made his fortune by essentially, being a good liar. It really defines who Romney is. Third, the vice presidential debate format lent itself to the approach Biden implemented. Tuesday night's debate will be a town hall, a completely different animal. Fourth, Obama is simply not the type of person who enjoys that type of political combat. He has to be true to himself (indeed what made Biden's debate performance really work was its authenticity?it was pure Joe Biden.) So what should Obama do Tuesday? My recommendations on the flip (worth the price you paid for them).</p>

On <a href=""http://elections.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/11/1142917/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Polling-Wrap-Welcome-back-to-the-national-state-polling-divide-yes-again"">Thursday's edition</a> of the Polling Wrap, identifying the frontrunner in the race for the White House was a tougher task than one might think. And that is because of an extraordinary stat from the polls that night.
<p>Three pollsters (Gallup, Ipsos/Reuters and Monmouth) were kind enough to provide two topline results to their polling. For one topline, they took the temperature of the race among all of the registered voters who responded to their polling. In the other topline, they applied (as virtually all pollsters do, at this point in the cycle) a likely voter screen.</p>
<p>The amazing stat? President Barack Obama led in <i>none</i> of the three polls, where the likely voter screen was employed. But Mitt Romney led in <i>none</i> of the three polls, when the universe was registered voters.</p>
<p>There are, of course, two fairly logical explanations for this. For one thing, the national polling of the presidential race has grown extraordinarily close: Romney's margin in the three polls among LVs was a mere 1.7 percent, while Obama's margin with RVs was only 2.0 percent. For another, it has long been assumed that a likely voter screen is going to benefit the GOP, because of the (likely correct) assumption that more habitual voters are going to lean conservative.</p>
<p>With the end of the marathon in sight, however, and everyone eyeing the polls with ever-increasing intensity, today's dose of Daily Kos poll analysis is going to look at some assumptions about polling invoking the likely voter screen. Some of the things we think we know about utilizing this common polling technique are absolutely true, but there is also no shortage of mythology.</p>
<p>Below the fold, you will find the common rationale for tightening to a likely voter screen at election time, some of the potential pitfalls of doing so, and a study I conducted of 2004-2008 presidential election polling which will reinforce some assumptions about likely voter screens, and contradict others.</p>

I wish I knew whether to take this book as an elaborate piece of hyperbolic performance art or a serious argument. It's an entertaining and worthwhile read either way, but it sure would make it easier to assess.
<p>Take the opening:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Hang out in my living room on any national election night and at some point in the evening, usually around 7 p.m. Pacific time, you're almost certain to hear me scream something like: ""Why in the hell does the United States?and by extension the entire free world, capitalist dominion, and all of Christendom?allow its government to be held hostage by a coalition of bought-and-paid-for political swamp scum from the most uneducated, morbidly obese, racist, indigent, xenophobic, socially stunted, and generally ass-backwards part of the country?""</blockquote>
With a set-up like that, it's tempting to think you're going to be treated to a good, old-fashioned polemic?a barnburner of a thought experiment, a cathartic liberal lambasting meant to simply make put-upon, beat up liberals feel good (or to feel bad, and feel good about feeling bad).
<p>And the book works fine on that level. It revisits many of the topics and situations that drive us nuts here on Daily Kos: how blue states pay, on average, so much more in federal taxes than they receive; that the red states have the highest percentage of folks taking federal dollars out of the system even as they whine and swagger about being ""small government"" advocates; the casual and clueless, almost daily, exhibitions of racism common in the South; the glorification of traitors known as the worship of the ""lost cause"" of the Confederacy; and on and on and on.</p>
<p>But there appears to be more to the author's intention than that. On some level, it's clear he wants us to take seriously the notion of parting of the ways between the two incompatible parts of the country. He amasses data, and somewhere in between the fire and the brimstone, plans of serious argument are laid down. It's hard to dismiss as merely preaching to the choir a book that has 25 pages of detailed data in end notes at the back.</p>
<p>Still ? that divine, bitter, over-the-top snark? That whole chapter (short, granted, but ? &nbsp;a whole chapter?) devoted to arguing that the SEC college football conference is one of the main arguments for separation between North and South, placed on an equal basis with sections on religion, racism and education? Really?</p>

<blockquote>...what separates successful states from failed ones is whether their governing institutions are inclusive or extractive. Extractive states are controlled by ruling elites whose objective is to extract as much wealth as they can from the rest of society. Inclusive states give everyone access to economic opportunity; often, greater inclusiveness creates more prosperity, which creates an incentive for ever greater inclusiveness.
<p>The history of the United States can be read as one such virtuous circle. But... virtuous circles can be broken. Elites that have prospered from inclusive systems can be tempted to pull up the ladder they climbed to the top. Eventually, their societies become extractive and their economies languish.</p>
<p>That was the future predicted by Karl Marx, who wrote that capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction. And it is the danger America faces today, as the 1 percent pulls away from everyone else and pursues an economic, political and social agenda that will increase that gap even further ? ultimately destroying the open system that made America rich and allowed its 1 percent to thrive in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
We tend to forget just how young our system of corporate capitalism really is. This economy we all sail in is a fragile, leaky ship prone to sudden failures and often in need of course correction. It's time for a big turn, a <i>big</i> turn if we're going to stay off the rocks.
<blockquote>Even as the winner-take-all economy has enriched those at the very top, their tax burden has lightened. Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks. In the 1950s, the marginal income tax rate for those at the top of the distribution soared above 90 percent, a figure that today makes even Democrats flinch. Meanwhile, of the 400 richest taxpayers in 2009, 6 paid no federal income tax at all, and 27 paid 10 percent or less. None paid more than 35 percent.</blockquote>
<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/which-millionaire-are-you-voting-for.html"">Nicholas Carnes</a> notes that while we may argue over whose policies are most slanted toward the 1%, all too often our only choices are candidates who are <u>in</u> the 1%.
<blockquote>Elections are supposed to give us choices. We can reward incumbents or we can throw the bums out. We can choose Republicans or Democrats. We can choose conservative policies or progressive ones.
<p>In most elections, however, we don?t get a say in something important: whether we?re governed by the rich. By Election Day, that choice has usually been made for us. Would you like to be represented by a millionaire lawyer or a millionaire businessman? Even in our great democracy, we rarely have the option to put someone in office who isn?t part of the elite.</p>
</blockquote>
It's certainly possible for someone who is wealthy to champion the downtrodden (witness Teddy Kennedy), but in a representative democracy, where we so rightly worry that our government doesn't align with the distribution of race and gender among the public, why are we so willing to accept a government sharply unrepresentative when it comes to class?
<blockquote>If millionaires were a political party, that party would make up roughly 3 percent of American families, but it would have a super-majority in the Senate, a majority in the House, a majority on the Supreme Court and a man in the White House. If working-class Americans were a political party, that party would have made up more than half the country since the start of the 20th century. But legislators from that party (those who last worked in blue-collar jobs before entering politics) would never have held more than 2 percent of the seats in Congress.</blockquote>
That disparity has huge consequences. It's very hard to have a government that isn't for the rich, when that government is both of and by the rich.
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/bruni-bachmann-family-values.html"">Frank Bruni</a> shows that, if you ever had any doubt, Michelle Bachmann doesn't care who she hurts.</p>
<blockquote>Helen was at Michele?s wedding to Marcus Bachmann and got to know him. And Michele got to know Nia, the woman who has been Helen?s partner for almost 25 years.
<p>Helen never had a conversation about her sexual orientation with Michele and knew that Michele?s evangelical Christianity was deeply felt. Still she couldn?t believe it when, about a decade ago, Michele began to use her position as a state senator in Minnesota to call out gays and lesbians as sick and evil and to push for an amendment to the Minnesota constitution that would prohibit same-sex marriage: precisely the kind of amendment that Minnesotans will vote on in a referendum on Election Day.</p>
<p>?It felt so divorced from having known me, from having known somebody who?s gay,? said Helen, a soft-spoken woman with a gentle air. ?I was just stunned.?</p>
</blockquote>
Helen wrote her stepsister about her shock over the things Bachmann was saying, and the political steps she was taking. Bachmann did not reply.
<blockquote>When Michele spoke at a State Senate hearing in 2006 about her desire for a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage, Helen showed up...
<p>?I wasn?t looking to make a public statement,? she told me. ?I just thought: I?m going to go there and sit there so she has to look at me. So she has to look at Nia. I wanted her to see: this is who you?re doing this to. It?s not some anonymous group of people. It?s not scary people. It?s me. It?s Nia.? She paused, because she?d begun to sob.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>George Will has a title that almost makes me think his column could be worth reading. I am not falling for it.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/biden-2016-it-could-happen-my-friend/2012/10/12/d380a3a2-1314-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story_1.html"">Jules Witcover</a> wonders if last week's debate could be a preview of 2016.</p>
<blockquote>As Biden approaches his 70th birthday in November, one hears talk ? certainly not discouraged by him ? of a third presidential try in 2016. At 73, he would be one of the oldest Americans to seek his country?s highest office, surpassing Reagan?s 69 in 1980 and equaling Reagan?s age at reelection.</blockquote>
Biden vs. Clinton for the Democratic nod in 2016? That would be a fun match up.
<p>Most people would argue that there should be few limits on free speech, and Daily Kos has long supported the idea that the ability to post anonymously is an important part of maintaining a free flow of ideas online. In my own time on DK, I know that I expressed ideas that might have been costly to myself and my family when posting under a pseudonym, and since deciding to ""out"" myself, I've also self-censored to a degree that makes me more than a little ashamed. I was braver, on topics that really matter, when I faced less chance of personal consequence. But should there be limits on what you can say anonymously? &nbsp;<a href=""http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web"">Gawker</a> has outed one of the most notorious users of Reddit, a man who many regarded as a friend and mentor, but who also started a group for praising Hitler and another group dedicated to posting images of dead teenage girls. Is there a point where anonymity becomes a weapon?</p>

<div class=""dkimg-cap"">Still the same old Mitt</div>
</div>
With everyone focused on President Obama's lousy debate, Mitt Romney's significant but not game-changing bump in the polls, and consecutive weeks of good economic news, many have forgotten that Romney remains the same Romney he has always been. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/07/1140436/-Debate-advice-for-President-Obama-Mitt-Romney-will-tell-a-lot-of-lies-and-you-must-refute-them?detail=hide"">Gleefully mendacious</a> during the debate. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/10/1142865/-Open-thread-for-night-owls-Mitt-the-Grifter?detail=hide"">Flip-flopping</a> at a pace that makes mere mortal observers dizzy. And still the elitist exemplar of everything that is wrong with our economic system.
<p>Romney still hasn't released his <a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/09/mitt-romney-tax-returns"">tax returns</a>. He still has uncountable piles of cash stored in tax-free offshore bank accounts in <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2012/0922/Romney-tax-returns-What-s-missing-in-his-report"">Bermuda and the Cayman Islands</a>. He still has <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/11/1143096/-Romney-reiterates-claim-that-ER-is-health-care?detail=hide"">no clue about nor empathy for</a> how the less fortunate live. We shouldn't forget that. We shouldn't forget that Romney still doesn't want the voters to know what's hiding in his tax returns, and that the only reason for that is that he knows that if the voters know what's hiding in his tax returns they will be less likely to vote for him.</p>
<p>And remember <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/17/1132918/-Obama-campaign-says-Romney-has-disdainfully-written-off-half-the-nation?detail=hide"">that 47 percent video</a>?

But it would be instructive for everyone to watch it again.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Which is the real Romney? Granted, that can be asked about Romney on pretty much <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/mitt-romneys-biggest-flip-flops-20120801"">every issue</a>, but everyone should watch that video again. Was the real Romney the one in political damage control, walking it back, attempting to distance himself from the Romney on the video? Or is the real Romney the one speaking candidly, in private, revealing such visceral disdain for 47 percent of this country? You decide.</p>
<p>Tax returns. Bermuda and Cayman Islands bank accounts. Forty-seven percent. Don't forget them.</p>

I find it surprising that the now completely effing insane Joe Arpaio is still even running for sheriff again, given the multiple fiascos that have defined his office over the last few years, but he is. He's also a <em>huge</em> coward, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/joe-arpaio-called-a-chicken_n_1959318.html"">refusing all debates with his opponents.</a><br />
<blockquote>But Arpaio isn't budging. He told Phoenix TV station KASW that he doesn't need to debate because he has been in office long enough for the public to know his record.
<p>""I don't have to debate the two people running against me,"" the Maricopa County sheriff said, KASW reported. ""Maybe they can debate themselves and let the public know who they are, which they don?t."" [?]</p>
<p>Arpaio opponent Paul Penzone told KASW he thinks Arpaio ""owes it to the voters to stand next to his opponents and have the courage to answer questions.""</p>
</blockquote>
You would think so, but nope. Arpaio is apparently quite confident that yes, most Maricopa County residents are still batshit crazy enough to give him another term of office?at least so long as he keeps his mouth shut for a while. I'm not saying he's wrong, but as far as I can tell he hasn't even been pretending to do his actual job lately. Maybe he should retire and sell his crackpot conspiracy theories on the internet? I hear that's become <em>very</em> popular these days.

Papa John's has company in the Obamacare fear-mongering game. Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, Red Lobster and others, is joining the pizza chain in threatening dire consequences stemming from the requirement that large companies offer affordable health insurance to employees working 30 or more hours a week. But where <a href=""http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/papa-johns-obamacare-will-raise-pizza-prices-131331.html"">Papa John's</a> has threatened to pass the 11 to 14 cent per pizza added cost it claims will come from insuring or refusing to insure their workers along to customers, <a href=""http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-10-07/business/os-darden-part-time-workers-20121007_1_darden-restaurants-health-insurance-olive-gardens"">Darden is sticking it straight to its workers</a> by planning to make sure hourly workers just don't get the 30 hours a week that would tip them over into qualifying for insurance.
<p>Here's the thing: Obamacare or no, this is completely typical behavior from Darden. The chain already keeps 75 percent of its hourly workers below 30 hours of work a week, and:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Darden has been aggressively keeping labor costs down. It has cut bartenders' pay and required servers to share tips with them. It also has eliminated busboy positions at Red Lobster and reduced the number of servers working each shift at that chain.
<p>Labor costs as a percentage of sales have dropped steadily from 33.1 percent in fiscal 2010 to 30.8 percent in the most recent quarter.</p>
</blockquote>
What we have here is not some Obamacare cataclysm of good employers being forced to cut their employees' hours or go out of business. Rather, it's a food service sweatshop finding one more way to screw its workers. Darden is <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/23/1112800/-Big-companies-employ-two-in-three-low-wage-workers?detail=hide"">one of the 20 largest low-wage employers</a> in the country; meanwhile, it was profitable in the last fiscal year and over the last three fiscal years, and has higher revenues, profits, operating margins and cash holdings than prior to the recession. In recent years, Darden has paid <a href=""http://rocunited.org/dardens-decision-which-future-for-olive-garden-red-lobster-and-capital-grille/"">nearly $14 million in fines and settlements for wage theft</a>.
<p>It's a sad fact that almost any time you're eating in a restaurant, you're in a low-wage, low-benefits workplace. Usually, employers who've taken the high road are the only ones that stand out in the restaurant industry. But Darden has repeatedly distinguished itself by being one of the worst employers in an industry of bad employers. That it would use Obamacare as an excuse to cut the hours of the few remaining full-time hourly workers in an overwhelmingly part-time workforce is hardly a surprise.</p>

With <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/12/1143867/-Hell-to-Pay-Hang-up-on-this-dude-man?detail=hide"">49 percent of the vote</a>, you demanded payback for Allen West. Well, you got it.
<p>How do you even begin to describe Rep. Allen West and just why he's so deserving of this? From his <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/21/1134659/-Allen-West-thinks-women-are-out-to-neuter-him-so-let-s-neuter-him-right-out-of-office"">rampant misogyny</a>, flights of <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/25/1136273/-Allen-West-nearly-tops-his-last-delusion"">dangerous international fantasy</a>, extreme <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/11/1118636/-Allen-West-finds-something-to-get-outraged-about"">paranoia</a>, <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/04/11/1082436/-Allen-West-I-Hold-In-My-Hand-A-List-Of-80-Communist-Party-Members-In-The-Dem-Caucus"">boorishness</a>, and <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/16/1046114/-Rep-Allen-West-says-Democrats-are-like-Nazis-but-don-t-quote-him-on-that"">brutishness</a>, to his <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/02/1105399/-Incessantly-stupid-Rep-Allen-West-says-Obama-wants-you-to-be-his-slave"">rampant stupidity</a>, West gives Michele Bachmann, Joe Walsh, Todd Akin and Steve King combined a run for their money. This is one guy it's impossible to be hyperbolic about. Seriously, how can you possibly match the outrageousness? There just aren't enough words.</p>
<p>There were actually two specific things West did this week (well, there are probably dozens, but we don't have all night here) to deserve the title of worst politician of the week. First, he ran this ad, which tells Florida that Patrick Murphy personally was responsible for cutting Medicare by $700 billion. Check out the screen and the narration starting at the 14-second mark:<br /></p>
<div class=""dkimg-c""></div>
Wow, Patrick Murphy cut $700 billion from Medicare! That is quite the feat, considering he's not even in Congress yet. But what makes it even more special, <a href=""http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/allen-west-rips-opponent-medicare-cuts-west-voted"">it's the same goddamned cuts</a> West <i>did</i> vote for, in the Paul Ryan budget. And when he cast that vote, he said: ""Anyone challenging me on my support to this visionary plan to restore our economic security will be signing up for a suicide mission."" Come and get us, tough guy.
<p>Then there's the mailer that West <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/11/1143250/-West-mailer-attack-Murphy-for-associating-with-Soros-terrrorists#comments"">is blanketing FL-18</a> with, accusing Murphy of receiving support from terrorists who want to destroy Israel. Here's what it says about Murphy, in part:<br /></p>
<blockquote>At a time when there's so much danger and uncertainty in the Middle East, we need leaders who will stand up for Israel. Unfortunately, there are some in America who are weakening that commitment, and they support Patrick Murphy.
<p>President Obama, who hasn't visited Israel once during his entire term in office, supports Patrick Murphy. An anti-Israel group that received funding from billionaire George Soros and whose co-founder met with Hamas also endorse him. Murphy's Super PAC even took $100,000 from an alleged sponsor of terrorism against Israel.</p>

President Obama and George Soros? Where's Hitler? Cuz you know when West goes nuts, the <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/16/1046114/-Rep-Allen-West-says-Democrats-are-like-Nazis-but-don-t-quote-him-on-that"">the Nazi references</a> aren't far behind.
<p>There's oh, so much more to say about Allen West and why we need to boot his ass out of Congress. But, really, is it necessary? Do you really need to me to convince you that he's got to go? Of course not. So then, let's get to it!</p>

Here's supposed Republican senate material Todd Akin talking about evolution (or, rather, not talking about it), in the process once again proving that he is indeed <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/10/12/1003121/todd-akin-no-science-behind-evolution/"">a perfect representative of his party.</a><br />
<blockquote>I don?t see it as even a matter of science because I don?t know that you can prove one or the other. That?s one of those things. We can talk about theology and all of those other things but I?m basically concerned about, you?ve got a choice between Claire McCaskill and myself. My job is to make the thing there. If we want to do theoretical stuff, we can do that, but I think I better stay on topic.</blockquote>
Got that? Evolution is not science at all, because Todd Akin doesn't think millions of years of fossil records are enough to prove it. At least, not to the point where it could take precedent over, say, blind theological faith in that stuff not happening.
<p>I think what we have here is a case of scientific illiteracy. I don't mean ""Todd Akin does not know the science,"" I mean the more basic kind, where there are a great many Americans who do not understand the <em>concept</em> of ""evidence,"" or ""proof,"" or any of the other things that separate knowing a thing from simply declaring any other possibility to be equally true. You can prove that chickens lay eggs because you can observe a chicken doing it, but there are people who will tell you that it is <em>equally</em> likely that an alien race stopped time, lifted up the chicken, put an egg under the chicken and started time back up again because you cannot ""prove"" that version did not happen. Again, it is a case of conveniently finding God at the exact boundaries of your own <em>personal</em> knowledge, and then pinning those boundaries as the only God-fearing ones possible. The boundaries chosen are always peculiar ones?I have never known anyone to argue that a pocket calculator adds numbers together because God Did It, for example?but nearly always seem to exist in whatever little nooks might suggest that humans are a part of nature, and not a divine special case set apart from all the rest. Perhaps evolution <em>does</em> exist in dogs and cats and monkeys, many of the less ardent anti-evolutionists will tell you, but not that last link between them and us. <em>That</em> link is the one never to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>What was I going on about? Ah, right, that Todd Akin is an imbecile. And that he doesn't know how science works, but I suppose we knew both of those things already. First he declares that ""legitimately"" raped women can't get pregnant because of some pseudoscience he apparently read on the internet somewhere, and now he declares that all of evolutionary science is merely a ""theology"" because he says so. A real poster child for modern conservatism, that one.</p>
